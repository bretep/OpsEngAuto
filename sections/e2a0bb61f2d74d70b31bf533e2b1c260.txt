### [[2.5.6: Class of Work: a specific type of work that is done, may be domain specific or general across the company]]

We briefly defined Class of Work in the beginning of the book, but let's take a slightly deeper look at what it means.

Initially I just said it was "anything that is done", and this is true but perhaps "work" work suffice to say that, and everyone would understand.

However, there is more depth we can gain from looking at it deeper.

I initially used the example of automating the DNS zone file updating.

If you aren't familiar with DNS zone files, they are text files look like this:

{{ example_dns_zone_file }}
