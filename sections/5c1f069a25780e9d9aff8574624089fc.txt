### [[3.8.2: Fashion Oriented Engineering.  ]]

This section is a little tricky for me, because it's a thin line between just gathering information and using it, and "blindly following things" or simply acting out fashions.  These are all highly subjective, and trying to write up the history of these "Fashion Eras" in technology mostly reads like it is a valid progression.  The problem is to the extent any information is valid, for your context, not that the information contains potentially valid information.

This is the problem with rationalization, and anything can be rationalized.  However, Rationalization and Engineering are not the same thing.

So I'll just that simply state that reading other organization's Public Relations releases on what they are doing and how they are doing it, is frequently information one cannot validate.

Taking it as a data point and deciding whether a given methodology works for one's environment, with one's resources, is Engineering.

Simply doing something because an Authority has said they do it, and worked well for them, is accepting their Appeal to Authority (a logical fallacy).  They don't even need to appeal to anyone, people do the appealing themselves just from seeing the content and knowing that the organization has some social credit or prestige.

I have been in far too many meetings where a problem was brought up, and then someone mentioned a blog post from some currently-fashionable-company, and then the consensus was to do what the blog post said, without properly evaluating whether it was a good fit for us, or a valid technique in our context.  

This is outsourcing one's infrastructure design and decisions to a party that does not know one's environment, one's resources, one's goals, and was probably not even intentionally telling anyone to follow their path.  This is giving up "agency", or ability to make one's own decisions, based on one's own data and context.  In fact, discussion against this course-of-action was sometimes seen challenging the legitimacy of the organization who made the press release.

I refer to this as Fashion Oriented Engineering (FOE) or "Blogineering".

Maybe these are good techniques, and if we evaluate them in the way we evaluate everything else as an Engineering decision, then it is not Fashion, it is Engineering.

However, if one simply says "I read on Famous Company X's blog, they were doing Y.  Let's do Y.", this is not Engineering.  This is following a fashion trend setter.

I have been at organizations that made very well received press releases (through their engineering blog) that completely mischaracterized what was going on in their environment (from my perspective), and it was well accepted by many others in the industry.

Why?  Because they have no idea that if they actually worked at that organization, they might completely disagree with the statements, because they have more information and could see the chain of events, and the effects of the recommended practice.  There are many colloquial phrases such as "putting lipstick on a pig".

No one is going to publicly announce that they are making a mess of their operations, but if their management want them to make press releases (blog posts), then they are going to do that, and do it in a way that makes them look good.

They have an incentive to "spin" things to a positive, regardless of real Engineering going on.

So Buyer Beware!  Engineering blogs are press releases, and like any press release they are effectively "selling" something, such as how great a place they are to work, or how efficient and intelligent they are.

There is nothing wrong with these press releases, they are a good thing, as they share information, and may be very useful.  However, they should be taken as information in the sense of, "Organizating X made a press release where they said Y".

This is true, and can be useful.  Simply doing what one interprets from their release doesn't even mean that they communicated it properly, or their intent was understood properly, and it is a summarization, so it is only giving a limited insight into the reality behind the post, at best.

Just something to keep in mind.  Fashion and Engineering are not compatible in making decisions, and there is a lot of Fashion going on.
