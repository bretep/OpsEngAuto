### [[3.8.2: Fashion Based Engineering.  "Blogineering".  real evaluations of the environment, agreement between team on details, moving forward.  How to do it quickly.   Honesty in public relations, be skeptical of the claims of others.  No one will state they are fuckups, but that doesnt mean they arent asked to blog about their operational endeavours anyway.  What works for them may not work for you, apply Axiomatic Engineering principles, decided by you and your team.  Use everyone for source information, but nothing as universally applicable.  It's just another idea, including this one.  In-take, evaluate, match to your environment (synthesize), iterate, evaluate, repeat.]]
