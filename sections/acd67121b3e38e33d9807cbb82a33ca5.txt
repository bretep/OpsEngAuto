### [[Chapter 9: Planet Scale Automation]]

[Placeholder for the time being, just to briefly explain]

UM = Function + Side Effects = A method for describing any individual action

UMC = Universal Machine Context.  A label for a set of UMs.  These are actions that are all related to each other, so all UMs in a UMC can be said to be on the same "layer".

UMCR = UMC Relationship.  A mapping from either an input, output or effect, from one UMC UM to another UMC UM.  This is described *as* a UM.  The set of all UMCRs between two UMCs is itself a UMC.  The UMC of the relationship between the two UMCs.

In this way, all functions can be mapped, for any "context" or "layer", and then all contexts/layers can be mapped, and then all relationships between all contexts and layers can be mapped.

Does this need to be taken to it's extreme with a full-mesh mapping?  No.

It is only important that we have a mechanism for how to link the different layers we will eventually end up creating together under a scalable and simple system, which this is.  I believe there is probably no simpler system that can be invented to describe this set of complex relationships together, because there is a minimal set of data being tracked.

One would have to track less data, and do the same or more work to create a better effect, so I can state I believe this is currently an optimal solution for the present understanding of how we could scale to full-mesh style sizes of Planet Scale Automation.
