### [[2.6: The Philosophy of Pragmatism]]

Pragmatism is a formally written up philosophy, and you read more in-depth about it on the Internet or various books.

For the purpose of this book, we'll be using it in it's core form which is:

"Pragmatism is when you only evaluate an action based on the effects, and nothing else."

"Effects" are different than "results", because results is more about what you wanted to achieve, and whether you felt you achieved that thing or not.

Effects is more general, and deals with all things that come from an action.

There can be a lot of confusion with the word "pragmatism", and it is often used interchangeably with "practical", and sometimes conflated with "common knowledge", but it does not mean these things, and for the purpose of this book we will be strictly avoided any conflation with "practical".

"Practical" is a very loose term that means efficient in both resources and results, it gives you "good enough" results, with an acceptable amount of resource usage.

This has nothing to do with Pragmatism, as Pragmatism has no concern for the amount of resources that were used, or if the burden was terrible, or whether it was convenient.  These things may show up in the "effects" of an action, such as the amount of resources impacted is part of the effect, but "practical" ties these things together as being important in the concept, whereas with Pragmatism, all of the effects are simply data and will be evaluated as to whether those are desirable effects, or not.

This also covers another topic that causes confusion which is "side-effects", and although this is useful in language to denote things that occurred that may not have been part of the "main" or "center" (hence, "side"), in truth all things are simply effects.  Whether they are in the "center" or the "side" is based on your perspective, and likely to cause partial blindness when ignored.

Grouping everything into only one single pool of "effects" is the better way to do this, when you prioritize for accuracy and clarity, because you are not trying to push anything to the "side-lines" and are seeing all effects as being caused by your action, and thus will evaluate that action more comprehensively.

What are we excluding when we only look at effects?

Initially, we are excluding our value judgements, our goals, our history, culture, feelings, wants and desires, and anything else, so that we can focus on dealing with "what changed?" or "what will change?", and detailing these effects (changes) qualitatively and quantitatively, where possible for each.

This allows us to go beyond whatever limitations we might be currently bound by, if we don't apply them to the situation before we have enumerated and started to evaluate all of the effects, not merely the effects we want to focus on.

In terms of getting coverage like "all of something", we are obviously talking about potentially a lot of data and too much to grasp at any time, and this is where Systemic Thinking and Slicing the Pie come into effect, in that we can box these effects into groups, to be inspected in more detail as needed, or viewed from farther away, and seen with less detail.

Again, this ability to scale in or out from details, is an important skill that needs to be developed and applied to get a good grasp on what is going on.  Without this, one is going to be "stuck" with the view from one's current perspective.

I like to give examples with every topic I introduce, but I don't think it's the right time to go into an example deeply on this, so we will just touch the surface of an example we will delve into deeply soon.

How can we use Pragmatism to get better results?

For instance, one thing that we are concerned about greatly in Production Operations is "up-time", which is the Availability of our services.

How do we get the "best" (most) up-time?  Well, the most important thing is actually a "negative", which is "don't go down".  However, "not going down" takes "all the things" working all the time, even when things fail.  This is obviously a very complicated endeavor to try to improve.

By using Pragmatism, and only focusing on the "effects" of doing one thing, versus another thing, we can evaluate that method with the highest signal-to-noise ratio, so that we are spending more time thinking of the most-relevant things, and are actively trying to avoid things that may be distractions.

Knowing that one thing that causes down-time events is "Humans making changes" we can say that we want to optimize for making more changes through automation, and less changes through direct Human manual (by hand) efforts.

Since Logic is able to be written so that it runs deterministically (if done "properly"), then this Determinism is an attribute which helps us improve our up-time, by removing the non-determinism of manual Human changes.

We can evaluate these based on the effects of what happens when Logic updates a DNS Zone file 10000 times, versus having Humans update a DNS Zone file 10000 times.  From these cumulative effects, we can see that the Humans will make more mistakes in the act of updating the zone file, than the Logic will, and thus the effect of Human edits are more errors, which reduce our up-time.

There is a lot more detail that could go into this analysis, as with anything, but this is getting our feet on the path of how to analyze things by their effects, trying to strip out anything that is not an effect of the process.
