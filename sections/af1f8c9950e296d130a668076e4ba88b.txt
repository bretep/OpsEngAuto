### [[2.6: The Philosophy of Pragmatism]]

Pragmatism is a formally written up philosophy, and you read more in-depth about it on the Internet or various books.

For the purpose of this book, we'll be using it in it's core form which is:

"Pragmatism is when you only evaluate an action based on the effects, and nothing else."

"Effects" are different than "results", because results is more about what you wanted to achieve, and whether you felt you achieved that thing or not.

Effects is more general, and deals with all things that come from an action.

There can be a lot of confusion with the word "pragmatism", and it is often used interchangeably with "practical", and sometimes conflated with "common knowledge", but it does not mean these things, and for the purpose of this book we will be strictly avoided any conflation with "practical".

"Practical" is a very loose term that means efficient in both resources and results, it gives you "good enough" results, with an acceptable amount of resource usage.

This has nothing to do with Pragmatism, as Pragmatism has no concern for the amount of resources that were used, or if the burden was terrible, or whether it was convenient.  These things may show up in the "effects" of an action, such as the amount of resources impacted is part of the effect, but "practical" ties these things together as being important in the concept, whereas with Pragmatism, all of the effects are simply data and will be evaluated as to whether those are desirable effects, or not.

This also covers another topic that causes confusion which is "side-effects", and although this is useful in language to denote things that occurred that may not have been part of the "main" or "center" (hence, "side"), in truth all things are simply effects.  Whether they are in the "center" or the "side" is based on your perspective, and likely to cause partial blindness when ignored.

Grouping everything into only one single pool of "effects" is the better way to do this, when you prioritize for accuracy and clarity, because you are not trying to push anything to the "side-lines" and are seeing all effects as being caused by your action, and thus will evaluate that action more comprehensively.

What are we excluding when we only look at effects?

Initially, we are excluding our value judgements, our goals, our history, culture, feelings, wants and desires, and anything else, so that we can focus on dealing with "what changed?", and detailing these effects (changes) qualitatively and quantitatively, where possible for each.
