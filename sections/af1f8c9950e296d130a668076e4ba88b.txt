### [[2.6: The Philosophy of Pragmatism]]

Pragmatism is a formally written up philosophy, and you read more in-depth about it on the Internet or various books.

For the purpose of this book, we'll be using it in it's core form which is:

"Pragmatism is when you only evaluate an action based on the effects, and nothing else."

"Effects" are different than "results", because results is more about what you wanted to achieve, and whether you felt you achieved that thing or not.

Effects is more general, and deals with all things that come from an action.
