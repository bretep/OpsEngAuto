### [[2.6.8: Humans]]

It feels a bit weird when I say or write "Humans", as it's strangely impersonalizing to everyone, I feel.  However, it is conveniently clear to differentiate not only from "Not Human", or "Logic Based" or "Software" or whatever, but also clear in the sense that I am not speaking casually about people, but specifically about the type of effects that Humans cause.

We generalize about "people" all the time, different groups of them, to have any sort of discussion.  Sentences can only carry so much information in them at any given time, because words only have so much meaning, and a word is composed of syllables, and those take time to write or say, and they have to be done sequentially, the syllables cannot be written or said simultaneously to be more efficient, and so generalizing or summarization is required.

Without summarization and generalization, we would spend so much time getting to the point, by being maximally specific in every detail, much in the way I am doing right now, that we would just not get to the point, and all communication would cease to function.

Shouldn't there be a spectrum for this?  Let's make one:

Specificity  <----->  Generalization

Now we have an axis on which we can slide a variable across, to be more or less specific, and it can be tuned in the way we want it, for every circumstance that is possible.

In addition to this, we can add in another topic, such as "Atomicity" that we spoke of previously.

We can be extremely specific in our discussion of Atomicity, or we can be extremely General, or somewhere in between, in the spectrum, along the axis.  I will use this method of multiple examples mixed together to provide a richer tapestry for these ideas to be expressed in, as the book goes on.  These are tools for communicating more deeply than not, another spectrum or axis, which can be applied.

In fact, let's just combine some right now, and make a new tool.  We just discussed "Atomicity" as a topic, on the spectrum/axis of Specificity <--> Generalization.  Let's combine the Atomicity scale and the Specificity scale together, and create a topic based on the two dimensional coordinate system that those two axes create.

Atomicity:  Atomic <---> Not Atomic
Specificity:  Specific <---> General

I ended up righting these "Left to Right" in terms of the subject being in a full-state, or an empty-state, but they could just as easily be written "Right to Left" (in reverse order), if it is more convenient for the problem at hand to see them in that way.  This process of ordering things as needed for the current problem is another tool that can be applied, and which has properties that can be evaluated.  For the sake of keeping up a fluid pace, I can't go into detail on each of these things as they arrive, even though I would like to.
