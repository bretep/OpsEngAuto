### [[2.4.3: Systemic Thinking.  Philosophers Knife.  Slicing the pie vs Aggregation.  Completeness, ease of understanding, ease of building, life-cycle maintenance.  Where do you spend your time?]]

So far we've gone over the general definition of a system, and created some examples, and looked at how to slice components of a system up to leave the system intact, but able to looked at from different perspectives, and to separate out different components.

How does this affect our ability to perform operational duties?  How will it help in automation, and in the life-cycle management of an operational environment?

Firstly, if one cannot understand something in detail for one's self, then it will be difficult to work with that thing efficiently.  I hope I have shown that being able to slice up a topic in any way you would like can produce sub-divisions which allow inspection and description, and which do not change the whole of system, and can be sub-divided further, or sub-divided differently to provide examples to compare and contract with one another, and to inspect their relationships and how work might flow through them.

Once one has an understanding for one's self, then the ability to communicate effectively about the topic becomes a possibility.  If I don't understand a topic thoroughly, I will have a very hard time having a thorough discussion of that topic for someone else, in fact I believe this is impossible to do.  I must have a thorough and comprehensive understanding myself if I wish to be able to communicate with someone else with clarity.

Through the power of using systems and the philosopher's knife, and black-boxing, I can take topics I do not comprehensively understand, and transform them into topics I do comprehensively understand.

By reducing a system or component to it's Inputs, Outputs and known Side-Effects, I can clearly talk about what is going on as it relates to other systems or components.  

If I can come to an agreement on terms and what the Inputs, Outputs and Side-Effects are for the given systems/components we are talking about, we have a much higher likelihood of coming to consensus on what we are talking about, and will be less likely to be talking about completely different things, while we are trying to communicate about a problem, or a solution, or whatever.
