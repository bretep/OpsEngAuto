### [[1.4: Hopefully, this will provide you with a set of foundational experiences from my expeirence, in which you can use to form your own opinions, methods, philosophies, procedures, axioms, and systems.]]

The ultimate goal in this book is that it improves your ability to function as an operational engineer, and to write automation that achieves the results that you want.

If you find any areas difficult to understand, or believe that sections are not explained well or are incorrect, feel free to write me and I will try to get back to you and update the work as best I can.
