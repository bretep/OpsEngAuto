### [[1.3: Writing in the first-person.  I will try to write as much as possible in the first-person, as I am speaking of my opinions, my experiences, etc.  I also find that this avoids the tone that can be see as "scolding" or "commanding" in write, as in the second-person "you must do this", etc.  When reading speech in the first person, I am more likely to see the information as informative, coming from the writers' perspective, rather than commanding and authoritative, in that this is something you must do.]]
