### [[2.5.5: Real/Virtual.  Strict definitions.]]

I won't go through the explanation that I made in {{ section_ff17d94c0d49aab3e372e47b64b96ea7 }} again here, as I think we covered the differences between what I meant by real and un-real, or virtual there.

I'll just say that like other this-book-only terms, I will be using Real and Virtual as proper nouns to describe things I mean to be having physical properties as Real, and things that do not have physical properties are Virtual.

If this seems vague, please review {{ section_ff17d94c0d49aab3e372e47b64b96ea7 }} again, as the specific use of these terms for the purposes of this book is important for understanding what I'm trying to convey.
