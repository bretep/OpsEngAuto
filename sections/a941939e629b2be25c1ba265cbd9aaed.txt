### [[3.2: Difference between Application and Operational code]]

Is there a difference between Logic that is written for Operations automation and Logic that is written for non-Operations?

In my opinion, there is, and it is a big difference.  It doesn't need to exist, but it does exist, and they are not mildly different, but extremely different, at present ({{ CURRENT_YEAR }}).

I see this changing more in the future, as distributed programming environments not only become normal, as they are are now, but that we start to get generational levels of experience in the field.  Generation Levels of Experience is required because there are many lessons to be learned, and then summarized, and then classified, and then come up with procedures for handling, and then generationally iterate on all of this, and this work has barely begun.

I will call non-Operational Logic "Application Logic", even though it may not strictly fit your definition of what an Application is, since it changes under different contexts.  If we we're to put this on an axis, we could call it:

Application Logic  <----->  Operational Logic

For instance, in a Production web serving environment, you frequently have "Application Servers" which might run Java Tomcat, JBoss, or Ruby on Rails, or a Python, or other Logic required for producing dynamic web content.

These would be "Application Logic" in this terminology, as I'm using it.

**What is the difference between Application Logic and Operational Logic?**

The main difference is Resiliency and Minimal Dependencies, and these have a number of sub-parts.  Some examples:

- Application Logic requires that the environment that it runs in be configured, or the Logic will fail, and often will fall non-gracefully.  How gracefully it fails generally has to do with how "mature" the Logic is, in terms of it's life cycle.

Example: An application server is started without a required configuration file in a specific directory, so the application server program exits with a status code of 127 and output to STDERR "Cannot open file: /path/to/file".  This is reasonable for an Application server, because it needs to be completely and correctly configured for it to return the correct results to a client.

- Operational Logic is built to support infrastructure, with the knowledge that the infrastructure components are going to fail, and the Operational Logic needs to not only recognize the failures, but needs to continue to work in whatever ways are still available.  

Example: A operational software is written which will execute remote code on hosts, for the purposes of managing Application state.  The remote programs which are executed will modify the Application's state, so that clients will receive different information after the state change.  If the operational software cannot update the Application, perhaps because a file is missing (similar to the Application Logic example above), the Operational Logic cannot simply exit with an error code and message.  It cannot complete it's task correctly, but instead must continue to run, and create a local and remote log of the failure, with any additional environmental data that is required to help troubleshoot this problem, and then proper staff must be notified of this failure, and potentially other servers must be updated accordingly (rolled back, or different update), to account for the failure to update this Application state.

Don't misunderstand me and construe that I am criticizing Application Logic or their developers, and praising Operational Logic or their developers; they each have different goals, and so will produce works that have different results because of this.

The differences between Application and Operational Logic are due to differences in priorities and responsibilities.

Operational Logic is responsible for:

- Infrastructure configuration and on-going maintenance
- Configuring Application services and maintenance assistance
- Monitoring and notification of Operational and Application state
- Solving operational failures

Applications are made to provide end-users with:

- Correct and timely results, for a given Application

Application Logic has an expectation that the operational environment is working correctly, and so error detection and handling is typically rudimentary, and output and results are intended for Application experts.  This is a natural prioritization, and not an incorrect one.  Only organization that have grown large enough that the long-tail problems are causing them noticeable impact should attempt to prioritize making Application Logic to be more robust, like Operational Logic, though Application Logic design can take many lessons from Operational Logic design for very cheap or equivalent cost.

As an example, say there are a pair of relational databases in a Master/Slave configuration, and the Master node fails, because of the priorities for Application Logic, generally the application will just fail until the Master/Slave designators are updated to promote the Slave to Master (updated as moving a floating IP address or DNS name or IP record change, or from another directory-style service).

There are some good reasons why Application Logic currently behaves this way.  The first is that it takes extra Logic to determine what should happen if the primary database server goes away, and this will be (eventually, very short term, "several minutes, or under an hour") taken care of by the Operations team, through manual intervention or automation.

Some classes of databases have a multi-node approach from the beginning, to make these types of events less frequent, since a server can go down, but others will be up, and the Application can talk to any of them.  These databases still have failure cases though, and so the results can up being the same depending on the type of failure.

Part of the "extra Logic" is that Applications are meant to serve end-users, and the time put into making this extra resiliency is often prioritized to go into making additional or improved features.  Whether you agree or disagree that this should be the priority, it often is the priority, and it servers us well to accept Reality, and work within it's confines.  If we want to change this, we need to change the priorities by showing more value given with a different priority.  Difficult, but possible.

Additional to the Logic required to handle failures, is that Application code needs to be very stable for-it's-own-purposes, and adding in this kind of Logic means that during failures more cases may be found that could be handled, which means more changes to the Logic surrounding database access, which means more change/churn, and this leads to more potential bugs.  Specifically the kind of bugs that have data access requests failing, which is someone no one wants.

While I think with better education, and better base-libraries we can solve these problems and Application Logic can be more like Operational Logic in handling failures, or in fact leverage the same Logic, so that they are working hand-in-hand, I am making this point because this is not currently standard, and has never been historically standard.

Another thing that Operational Logic needs to do, is to simply have more information about the operational environment.  Seems like common sense, but since we are building from the foundations, it is necessary to state the details.

As we get into what it takes to construct Operational Logic the brief description I have given here will be born out by many more details and along many more axes, to determine how these things are different, but for now it is sufficient that we can see that they are indeed different things.
