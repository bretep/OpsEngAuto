### [[Chapter 2: Introduction]]

One of the foundational goals of this book will be to differentiate the real from the virtual.

This may seem like something that is common sense, but I have found wide breadth and scale disagreement on what is real and what is not real, and this creates a lot of communication and planning problems.

If we can't agree on what is real, how can we agree on our priorities?  We will value things differently, because we understand them differently at a very fundamental level, and all communication will be inaccurately moving past each other, instead of directly engaging with common terms and values.

The results will be poor, and without coming to terms with why this fundamental mis-communication is occurring, we may never be able to see eye-to-eye, and may end up being unable to work to get good results with each other.

Going to the very basics and working up from there will allow us to develop a common method of communicating, starting from terms, and moving to goals, and then priorities, and finally into axioms so that we can come up with plans where we agree on the components and end results.
