### [[2.4.1: Philosophers Knife]]

One important tool in creating systems is the concept of the "Philosopher's Knife".

This is a virtual knife, meant for cutting ideas into sections.

The most basic way of dividing ideas is to split them in half.

For instance, you can say something is "Black or White", and then take any concept and add it into the "Black camp" or the "White camp".  This is a basic process of sub-division with things that appear to be opposites.  In subtractive light frequencies, black is the absences of color, and white is all of the colors.  In additive pigments, black is the combination of all pigments required to absorb all frequencies, and white is the absence of pigments that absorb frequencies, so that the frequencies are refracted and appear to be total spectrum, or white.

Being able to divide things in this way is a useful tool, but it is also a primitive inspection of the information, and in fact creates a frame that excludes almost all data.

For instance, in making the split between "Black and White", the frame of reference created ignores that fact that black and white are both colors, which means they are very similar to each other, and much less different from each other than say the word "duck".

If we took the sets of "Black, White" and "Duck, Goose", we see that black and white have much more in common with each other than duck and goose.  Because of this, even though in our first example we contrasted black and white as opposites, they are in fact much more similarly related to each other than many other things.

This is both the power and the limitation of the philosophers knife.  It can reveal differences, and it can obfuscate similarities.  How you use it will depend on the results you are looking for, and your skill at applying this technique to create those results.

For our purposes, we are looking at how to use the philosophers knife to sub-divide systems, for the purposes of Systemic Thinking.

The most important element in creating a well-cut concept into a system, is that nothing is left behind.  The use of the philosopher's knife should account for all
