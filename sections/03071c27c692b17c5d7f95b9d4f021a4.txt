### [[2.4.1: Systemic Thinking Tool: The Philosopher's Knife]]

One important tool in creating systems is the concept of the "Philosopher's Knife".

This is a virtual knife, meant for cutting ideas into sections.

The most basic way of dividing ideas is to split them in half.  Bifurcation is the cleanest method of division, as everything in split into one of two possibilities, which allows for using binary methods of organization, such as binary trees for creating hierarchy, or quantifying values so that things can be sorted on an comparative axis (ex: smallest to larger, slowest to fastest, etc), or setting binary flags so that set theory and boolean logic can be used (ex: "Is an X?", "Has an X?").

For example, one can say something is "Black or White", and then take any concept and add it into the "Black camp" or the "White camp".  This is a basic process of sub-division with things that appear to be opposites.  In subtractive light frequencies, black is the absences of color, and white is all of the colors.  In additive pigments, black is the combination of all pigments required to absorb all frequencies, and white is the absence of pigments that absorb frequencies, so that the frequencies are refracted and appear to be total spectrum, or white.  

By stating your method for determining the color, and your method for assigning into "black or white" camps, you can create a repeatable, inspectable, qualifiable and quantifiable method for working on data.  You could create a color value from 0 to 255, and anything 0-127 is in the "Black" camp and anything 128-255 is in the "White" camp, and then additional operations could be performed on them.

Being able to divide things in this way is a useful tool, but it is also a primitive inspection of the information, and in fact creates a frame that excludes almost all data.  We all know that "black and white thinking" is simplistic, and the reason is that most of the information (color) is reduced out, when thinking in this way.  And yet, it has utility.  How can we use this utility, without being negatively effected by the loss of information?  This is a primary goal in creating Wisdom, which is how to balance something beneficial or detrimental, depending on how it is used, but through Wisdom of it's usage, the results are beneficial.

As a further example in making the split between "Black and White", the frame of reference created also ignores that fact that black and white are both colors, which means they are very similar to each other, and much less different from each other than say the word "duck".

If we took the sets of "Black, White" and "Duck, Goose", we see that black and white have much more in common with each other than duck and goose.  Because of this, even though in our first example we contrasted black and white as opposites, they are in fact much more similarly related to each other than many other things.

This is both the power and the limitation of the philosophers knife.  It can reveal differences, and it can obfuscate similarities.  How you use it will depend on the results you are looking for, and your skill at applying this technique to create those results.

For our purposes, we are looking at how to use the philosophers knife to sub-divide systems, for the purposes of Systemic Thinking.

The most important element in creating a well-cut concept into a system, is that nothing is left behind.  The use of the philosopher's knife should account for all components and options of a system, and while it is sub-dividing them, they never lose their whole.

Their "whole" is what makes up the "system".  If you lose a part of the system while sub-dividing it, you have not correctly used the philosophers knife.  This will be important when designing your system, implementing it, and troubleshooting it, or in creating a Model to understand an existing system.

Let's first use our previous example of the static HTTP web request.

I used the philosopher's knife on the system of "making HTTP requests from a web server over a network" to come up with 5 elements of the process:

- A communication network (Internet): part of the environment.
- A protocol and environment (TCP/IP on Linux): part of the environment.
- A request handler (web server on TCP port 80): the Input to the black-box.
- A content location (static files on local filesystem): a component of the Output to the black-box.
- A log location (appending results to log file): a Side-Effect of the black-box operation.

I could have sliced this in a different manner, and instead focused on the TCP packet exchange, or I could have cut it so we delved deeper into the end-user's process of getting it's request to the web server (LAN, routing, DNS, TCP handshakes, etc).

I was able to slice this process into the layer's I chose, because I wanted to discuss those elements, and not other elements.  This ability to exclude what information is being inspected, while not losing any of those excluded areas of data in the total picture is the real power of systemic thinking, is the function of the philosopher's knife in this process.

We can take the exact same example process, and re-slice it any way we want, and the events would be the same, but in the information we look at, and how we inspect it would be different.  The system has not changed, the actions that occur in reality did not change, the results did not change, the inputs, outputs and side-effects did not change, and yet we are able to look at the problem in a completely different way, and take different lessons and gather different information from it.
