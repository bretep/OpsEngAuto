### [[3.10: Understanding Engineering]]

I've said before that I think Engineering is:

{{ definition_begin__engineering }}
"The efficient use of resources to meet requirements to sufficiently satisfy your goals."
{{ definition_end__engineering }}

Let's break this down in a way where we can understand Engineering as a process.

If we wanted to make a sequence from general-to-specific in terms of honing in on understanding Engineering, we can start here:

- Environment		->
- Resources		->
- Requirements		->
- Goal			->
- Actions		->
- Changed Environment	-> 
- Desired Effects?  
- Efficient use of resources?  
- Management of environment?

We start with an Environment, in which we have Resources, and we have some kind of Requirements, which apply to some Goal(s), so we perform some Actions, which change the environment.

Do these Actions have the Desired Effects?

Did we make efficient use of our Resources?

How efficiently can we manage our environment?  What is it like day-to-day operating what we have built?

With the above sequence and prose description of that sequence, we have a starting place to understand what Engineering is.  It's something we do, it's something that produces results we may or may not want.  It changes things.

These are all things that can be said to describe Engineering, and shine lights on it's different surfaces, which show different things to different people, coming from different viewpoints.

Engineering is multi-faceted to an amazing degree, so we will have to describe it repeatedly in vague terms to cloak it in an overall shape that provides better understanding.

Like Local vs Global Alignment, Engineering can be understood in a small or shallow manner well Locally, but when compared against other descriptions which are equally accurate, they do not seem to Align well.

It is only through creating many Local descriptions which Align well, and combine together into a Global network of descriptions that Align well, that we can create a real understanding of what Engineering is.

What does Engineering mean to you?

How would you summarize it in a sentence, as I have?  How does your summary differ from mine?  What advantages do you see in your summary over mine?

Feel free to share your personal summaries with me, I am happy to hear how others view things, and expand my own understanding accordingly.
