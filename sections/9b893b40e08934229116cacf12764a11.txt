### [[3.10: Understanding Engineering]]

I've said before that I think Engineering is:

"The efficient use of resources to meet requirements to sufficiently satisfy your goals."

Let's break this down in a way where we can understand Engineering as a process.

If we wanted to make a sequence from general-to-specific in terms of honing in on understanding Engineering, we can start here:

- Environment		->
- Resources		->
- Requirements		->
- Goal			->
- Actions		->
- Changed Environment	-> 
- Desired Effects?  
- Efficient use of resources?  
- Management of environment?
