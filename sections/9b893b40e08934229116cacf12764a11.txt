### [[3.10: Understanding Engineering]]

I've said before that I think Engineering is:

{{ definition__engineering_begin }}
"The efficient use of resources to meet requirements to sufficiently satisfy your goals."
{{ definition__engineering_end }}

Let's break this down in a way where we can understand Engineering as a process.

If we wanted to make a sequence from general-to-specific in terms of honing in on understanding Engineering, we can start here:

- Environment		->
- Resources		->
- Requirements		->
- Goal			->
- Actions		->
- Changed Environment	-> 
- Desired Effects?  
- Efficient use of resources?  
- Management of environment?

We start with an Environment, in which we have Resources, and we have some kind of Requirements, which apply to some goal(s), so we perform some Actions, which change the environment.

Do these Actions have the Desired Effects?

Did we make efficient use of our Resources?

How efficiently can we manage our environment?  What is it like day-to-day operating what we have built?
