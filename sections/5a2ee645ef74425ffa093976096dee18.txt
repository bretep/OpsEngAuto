### [[2.5.5.3.1: Can never know everything about something Real (physical), because of limited insight into what is going on with it]]

The first important thing to know about the difference between Real and Virtual things is that you cannot know everything about a Real thing.

Determine what the state of a Real thing is is essentially impossible, but we can have approximations that are good enough.

Why is it impossible to know that "true state" of a real thing?  Because it's state varies with every atom, and collectively all the atoms of a physical thing are too numerous and beyond inspecting in many dimensions.

This is not taking this too far either, it is simply being clear about what is possible, and what is not.

So, if we can't know everything, then what is possible, and what are those limitations?

Let's take something fairly simple for example, such as temperature.  What temperature is a physical device, we will say a 1U 19" rack server?

Well, that depends on where you are measuring it from.  Modern servers can have dozens of temperature sensors throughout their chassis, and those temperature sensors will approximate the temperature fairly accurately for part of the device.

We could measure the each CPU socket temperature, and the temperature near the power supply, and the fans, and then we can approximate from these or list them, but there remains many places we are not even directly measuring.

It happens that this is not necessarily important for our purposes, but it is important to understand and accept that this data is simply not available to us, and we have sensors in place to detect some aspects of it.

Other aspects we may not have any sensors for.  For instance, mobile devices often come with accelerometers, which will detect movement of the devices.  Rack servers do not currently come with these sensors, and for a fairly reasonable reason, as they are not in demand.

But this is one type of data that we cannot collect about this server.  It could be that the amount of vibration the servers are going through could end up causing problems over large numbers of servers, and by doing correlative analysis on part failures with vibrations, and by determining where the vibrations were worse, we could contact our data center's staff and see if they could fix the problem, as it may be an undetected problem on their part.

This is a completely theoretical example, but it illustrates that there are things we know, but not completely (temperature), and there are things we do not know at all about Real things.
