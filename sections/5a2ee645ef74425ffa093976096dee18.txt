### [[2.5.5.3.1: Can never know everything about something Real (physical), because of limited insight into what is going on with it]]

The first important thing to know about the difference between Real and Virtual things is that you cannot know everything about a Real thing.

Determine what the state of a Real thing is is essentially impossible, but we can have approximations that are good enough.

Why is it impossible to know that "true state" of a real thing?  Because it's state varies with every atom, and collectively all the atoms of a physical thing are too numerous and beyond inspecting in many dimensions.

This is not taking this too far either, it is simply being clear about what is possible, and what is not.

So, if we can't know everything, then what is possible, and what are those limitations?
