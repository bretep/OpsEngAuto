### [[3.10.1.3: Algorithms: Idempotency, Sequence,]]

There are lots of important Algorithms in Engineering, they are Virtual and are frequently constrained to these types of things:

- Searching for data: Finding things based on some matching criteria
- Sorting data: Ordering data based on some sorting criteria
- Coordination: Locking, reference counting, signaling other coordination style actions
- Encoding/Decoding: Encryption, compression, encapsulation, and other wrap/unwrap style actions

There are other categories as well, but these are often what we think of in Operational Engineering when someone says "algorithms".

There are many good references for these, including Wikipedia or Donald Knuth's books, for a completely in-depth comparison between an encyclopedia of algorithms.

In terms of Operations, while we use these other algorithms, I will focusing on "Algorithmic Properties" and very fundamental Algorithms.

One important "Algorithmic Property" is Idempotency.  This means that when you apply an Algorithm with this Property that the result is always the same.  In simple mathematics this can be seen by "1 * 1 = 1".  "* 1" is the Algorithm, and the result is always the same as the same as the original value (1 == 1).

This has interesting mathematical uses, but in Operational Engineering, the use is that if we perform a function, we always have the same result.

Consider a Algorithm that ensures that a directory exits with a given
