### [[1.4: Writing Stylistic Conventions]]

There will likely be some writing stylistic conventions I use that are new for you to read, and perhaps you don't like, and certainly you will not find approved in English Grammar books.

I have developed my style of written communication over my life, and continue to refine it still.  I am more concerned with having my intent and detailed messages understood than in complying with grammatical rules, and so will bend and break them as needed to achieve my desired results.

As such, as I will quote "things" whenever I want to emphasize them specifically, as introduced by Alfred Korzybski, from his methodology of General Semantics.

I will also interject parentheticals (like this), whenever I want to make an immediate "aside" comment or clarification (like this).

I will also make up words whenever they seem to work better, or sometimes I will think I am making up a word, but it might end up being an existing word that I didn't know, and have a different meaning.  I will try to explain my meaning any time I think I am making a concept that may not be a standard one, so try to read it with my intent, instead of against a standard, as if I stuck to the standards I don't think I could get the details with the pacing that I want.

I am going to frequently switch words such as "I", "you", "we", "one" to account for the subject, and I have specific meanings for this:

- "I": I am talking about myself and my experience.  As previously said, I will try to do this as much as possible, because this is a transference of knowledge, from me to you.

- "You": I am talking about you, the reader.  I have written this for you, even though I probably don't know you, but I have you in mind when I am writing, and I am thinking "What will you be aware of at this time, from previous material?  What I am trying to get you to?  Is it clear to you?"

- "We": You and I are on a short journey together, although at different times and different places, but I am relaying information into this medium, and you are consuming this information, and that creates an informal relationship between us.  I like to think in terms of "we" for this, as it is a shared journey.  

When I write code I often like to document things like "Here we are doing this" and "We don't want this effect, so I am doing this".  In this "future readership" situation, I am thinking of the code documentation's future reader, which may be myself or someone else.  In either case, that reader will be in a different state than I was at the time I wrote the code and documented it, so I am trying to bridge that gap, and make it another "shared journey".

- "One": This is when I am trying to give advice to some sort of direction.  I really don't think I should be telling you what to do, and I don't want to.  I want to assist in enabling you to do things better, and to make your own choices, and make your own processes, and methodologies and philosophies.  Telling you to do things is in opposition to these goals, so I use the word "one", such as:

"One like's one's tea with slightly sweet biscuits."

It is kind-of the British Royal "we", but in reverse, is the "all encompassing singular", but I write it mostly so if you don't want to accept it is is still easier to digest, because it is directly toward the aether, and not directly at "you" in a tone of command.  When I hear people speaking in the British Royal tone-of-language, they use "one" in basically the same way I am using it.  I feel this is a way one can make generalizations and advice, without making the statement to pointed-at-you.

I will also hyphenate-things-to-make-compound-ideas.  This allows words to be read in the sense of "all these things are one thing", and help in any kind of grammatical parsing.

I was born and have lived almost exclusively in the United States of America, and only in a few small areas of that space, and so my language usage is set up in a certain way.  Additionally being an Internet-denizen, I have a very fluid use of that language.

My usage of English, or maybe American, may not be easy for you to parse if you are not familiar with the way people similar-to-myself communicate, or English may not be your first language.  

Even if you have a very similar usage of language that I do, the ideas I am expressing are complex and riddled with detail, so these mechanism of asides, and compound ideas, and such are methods to make parsing these ideas more clear.

I am mostly writing in a tone of conversation, and so will jump around more than if this was a text book.  This is certainly not a text book, and should not be read as such.

If you jump to a section, and find it extremely confusing, it is likely because ideas were introduced and specified in a previous section, and their immediate usage (without that previous information) may seem very alien indeed.

This is a trade-off between writing styles, and for this work I have chosen this style as the one I think will yield the best results for the audience most-likely to be able to intake this information and make use of it.  That is only a guess, but I have to pick a methodology and stick with it.
