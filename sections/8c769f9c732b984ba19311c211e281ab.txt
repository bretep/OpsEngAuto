### [[1.4: Writing Stylistic Conventions]]

There will likely be some writing stylistic conventions I use that are new for you to read, and perhaps you don't like, and certainly you will not find approved in English Grammar books.

I have developed my style of written communication over my life, and continue to refine it still.  I am more concerned with having my intent and detailed messages understood than in complying with grammatical rules, and so will bend and break them as needed to achieve my desired results.

As such, as I will quote "things" whenever I want to emphasize them specifically, as introduced by Alfred Korzybski, from his methodology of General Semantics.

I will also interject parentheticals (like this), whenever I want to make an immediate "aside" comment or clarification (like this).

I will also make up words whenever they seem to work better, or sometimes I will think I am making up a word, but it might end up being an existing word that I didn't know, and have a different meaning.  I will try to explain my meaning any time I think I am making a concept that may not be a standard one, so try to read it with my intent, instead of against a standard, as if I stuck to the standards I don't think I could get the details with the pacing that I want.
