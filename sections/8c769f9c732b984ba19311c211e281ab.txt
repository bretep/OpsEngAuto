### [[1.4: Writing Stylistic Conventions]]

There will likely be some writing stylistic conventions I use that are new for you to read, and perhaps you don't like, and certainly you will not find approved in English Grammar books.

I have developed my style of written communication over my life, and continue to refine it still.  I am more concerned with having my intent and detailed messages understood than in complying with grammatical rules, and so will bend and break them as needed to achieve my desired results.

As such, as I will quote "things" whenever I want to emphasize them specifically, as introduced by Alfred Korzybski, from his methodology of General Semantics.

I will also interject parentheticals (like this), whenever I want to make an immediate "aside" comment or clarification (like this).

I will also make up words whenever they seem to work better, or sometimes I will think I am making up a word, but it might end up being an existing word that I didn't know, and have a different meaning.  I will try to explain my meaning any time I think I am making a concept that may not be a standard one, so try to read it with my intent, instead of against a standard, as if I stuck to the standards I don't think I could get the details with the pacing that I want.

I am going to frequently switch words such as "I", "you", "we", "one" to account for the subject, and I have specific meanings for this:

- "I": I am talking about myself and my experience.  As previously said, I will try to do this as much as possible, because this is a transference of knowledge, from me to you.

- "You": I am talking about you, the reader.  I have written this for you, even though I probably don't know you, but I have you in mind when I am writing, and I am thinking "What will you be aware of at this time, from previous material?  What I am trying to get you to?  Is it clear to you?"

- "We": You and I are on a short journey together, although at different times and different places, but I am relaying information into this medium, and you are consuming this information, and that creates an informal relationship between us.  I like to think in terms of "we" for this, as it is a shared journey.  

When I write code I often like to document things like "Here we are doing this" and "We don't want this effect, so I am doing this".  In this "future readership" situation, I am thinking of the code documentation's future reader, which may be myself or someone else.  In either case, that reader will be in a different state than I was at the time I wrote the code and documented it, so I am trying to bridge that gap, and make it another "shared journey".

- "One": This is when I am trying to give advice to some sort of direction.  I really don't think I should be telling you what to do, and I don't want to.  I want to assist in enabling you to do things better, and to make your own choices, and make your own processes, and methodologies and philosophies.  Telling you to do things is in opposition to these goals, so I use the word "one", such as:

"One like's one's tea with slightly sweet biscuits."

It is kind-of the
