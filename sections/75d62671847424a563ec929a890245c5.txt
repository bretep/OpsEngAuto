### [[2.2: I only really know what I mysql have experienced.  Everything else is hear-say, and while there may be a solid model behind it, I do not actually have experience in the matter, so I cannot trust the information to make solid engineering decisions on.  If I have nothing better, I may need to use this as the best course of action, and it may sound like a good thing to try, so I might experiment with it, but I have to recognize that this is an experiment, and so there is a great risk of failure.]]
