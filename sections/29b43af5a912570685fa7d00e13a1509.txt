### [[9.3: Multi-Layer Systems]]


If comprehensive automation systems can be created as a Single-Layer System, than why would we ever need Multi-Layer Systems?

Why can't OpsDB scale into a Planet Scale Automation system without UMCs and UMCRs?

The reason is that OpsDB is taking a look at the data from a strictly virtual perspective.  It maps to physical devices, hardware and physical locations of things, and other physical attributes and issues, but it is primarily a logical system for controlling logical elements, which simply map to physical elements.
