### [[2.3: What is a System?]]

There are a lot of ways the word "system" could be used.  We're going to look at a general version of the word first, and then a specific version for our exact purposes afterwards.

When I was growing up and for the first 10 years of my career, operational engineers were called "System Administrators".  Today some people use this term derogatorily as lower-level or older style work, and while anyone can have any perspective they'd like, this is not consistent with history.

I was lucky enough to spend some around professional system administrators throughout the 1980s, before I was old enough to work, and I got to see them doing core dumps and reading through the hexadecimal output to find where the problems in their code were, and even fix some problems through a hex editor.  I also got to get a bit of their practical advice and viewpoints, and I believe that after 5 or so years of professional operations work the lessons I saw back then started to filter back in to be more conscious rather than subconscious guides and role models.

So what is a system?  Historically, in the computer industry, a system was often referred to as a single machine with an operating system on it, and the environment that was then configured on top of that to create a working environment.

So a system was sometimes a machine's hardware, an operating system was also a system, and the eventual configured environment was a system.

One of the interesting properties of the word "system" is that all of these things were and are true.  And all of these things together are also a system.

A system is an generalized term for a set of interrelated, connected things that work together to produce effects.  Like anything, it is black-boxable into inputs, outputs and side effects, and has sub-components which can be similarly black-boxed, etc.

So a system is a flexible term, and is something like an "environment" or an "ecosystem" in common usage.

I like to think of systems as being somewhat like virtual machines, in the actual sense not in the container operating system sense.  A system
