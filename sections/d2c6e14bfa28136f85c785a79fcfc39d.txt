### [[3.3.2: Creating Axioms from Axes]]

This will be one of the few places in the book that I use an external definition to help us get more clarity.  I used to always lead with dictionary definitions and quotes for things and I still am a fan of both these things, but if I am writing a book about how to think about things and evaluate them for yourself, it doesn't help to constantly source external material as an authority.

So accordingly to the greatest authority that was easily accessible on my phone as I wrote this, there are generally two types of Axioms.  Logical Axioms and Non-Logical Axioms.

Logical Axioms are where you say something so simple and concise, that it couldn't possible by disagreed with.

This might be something like:

"If Availability of your Production Operations is your top priority, you need to have a validation step before making a change to determine if the change will cause down-time or Unavailability."

This borders on a tautology, and that is OK, because it is being specific, and has utility.

Is "Availability" our Top Priority for our Production Environment?  If so, then we need to validate that a change to the Production Environment won't cause a problem with our Availability.   BAM!  Axiom!
