### [[9.9: Releasing the poison]]

This is the only non-Operations advice that I will give in this book, because I think it is the most important non-technical advice I can give, and it has to do with inter-human communication and inter-human relationships.

No matter what society, culture or place you are born in, grow up in, and live in, there are elements around you that are harmful to you, and affect you in a negative manner.

In dealing with other people, we often encounter negativity in many dimensions, whether it is in attitude, verbally, or physically.

And in our own actions, we ourselves will have negative attributes that are presented and may affect our co-workers, team mates, as well as ourselves, friends and family.

A term I have begun to use for this type of thing is "poison", and to use it in a sentence might be something like, "I am poisoned, and have become toxic and it is effecting myself and others".  This reads pretty harshly to me, but it is meant to be clarifying and not vague or down-played.

I believe that all of us are both our own greatest allies, and our own worst enemies.  Our own actions have more impact on us than any other individual's can have, because we are the ones who coordinate our actions every second of every of day of our lives, whether we are directly aware of the coordination for each action or not.

In term's of our larger group's influence on us, this is actually more of our own influence on ourselves, as we have interpreted the intention of our larger society, culture or group, and our position in it.  I find conflict between my view of how I think I should fit into my group, versus how I would like to fit into my group.  And the same is true for "how the group thinks about me", to anthropomorphize the "collective dynamic" or "group think" or "social pressure" or "super ego" or whatever.

But, this is not merely negative, it is also positive, as I take the good things about my culture and group, and I am seen positively by them and myself, and I see the positive ways that I fit into the group, and they do me.

In order to improve myself, I need to focus more on seeing these positive things, and how others can see me positively, and less on the negative.  My attention alone will create time that I spend reflecting on the negative aspects, where I could be putting effort into actively making things more positive, and spending my time inspecting the positive aspects of things to determine how to strengthen them, and create more of them.

I refer to this, internally (and now written into a book, I guess), as "releasing the poison", which is releasing the things inside me that make me "more toxic", so that I can be "less toxic", with the goal of being "not toxic".

I say "releasing" instead of some other term, because these are active patterns in myself, things that I do, that I didn't have to do, but did.  So these are habits which need to be changed, but in order to do something else, I must stop doing what I am already doing.  So I refer to this as "releasing" it, as it is something I am "holding on to", which is why I keep doing it.  I think this distinction is important, as it underlines how this is completely an internal process, that I can accomplish myself, with no external validation.  

Why is it important that I can continue to make progress without external validation?  It is important, because if people act in negative ways to me or around me, I do not need to respond with negativity.  Responding with negativity creates a feedback loop, where one party is negative to another party, and the other responds with negativity (understandable, even if they were neutral or positive prior to the introduced negativity), and the first continues to respond negative and may increase it, and so on.

Because this feedback loop only intensifies until one of the party "turns down the volume", or turns it off, then it becomes clear why so many problems exist between people. 

I am certainly not through with my journey on this path, but I feel continual improvement as I have created an internal process of inspecting things that occur in my life, and comparing them to the model I have created for how I spend time related to negativity, versus how I spend time related to positivity.

This allows me to see where I have made mistakes more easily, and gives me the incentive to take action to try to correct those mistakes.  Often simply not taking action to correct a negative-effect action creates even more problems down the road which requires much work or may be unsalvageable, where taking a smaller effort earlier on, after detecting the problem, leads to less problems in the future.

If I have said or done something that may have caused a problem for someone, in any way, I can realize this and then mention it to them in passing, or ask to talk with them and go over what happened, and how I would prefer things were resolved, trying to fix any problems that were created, and create and keep a positive relationship with them.

This, however, does not mean that I ignore problems because "problems are negative".  I do not see problems being negative, even though "problem" and "obstacle" are normally negative-quality terms.  In engineering, and especially in more maintenance type aspects such as Operations, problems and obstacles are almost all we deal with.  Everything could be phrased as a problem, and it could be flipped around to being phrased as an opportunity.  

I don't recommend trying to phrase problems as opportunities all the time, because it leads to sounding unrealistic, but if you look at them positively, they really are opportunities that one can take advantage of to greater or lesser degrees to get greater or lesser benefits, if one can view them appropriately, and work with the knowledge gained from that vision into their nature.

I think this methodology this has been very good for me, and recommend spending some time to think about this, and how it intersects with your life, and who you are, and if you can think of ways that bring about similar improvements in your own life, which can make working with other people more enjoyable and efficient, and brings you more happiness, contentment and a more fulfilling life with more accomplishments and friends.
