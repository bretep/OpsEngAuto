### [[9.9: Releasing the poison]]

This is the only non-technical advice that I will give in this book, because I think it is the most important non-technical advice I can give, and it has to do with inter-human communication and inter-human relationships.

No matter what society, culture or place you are born in, grow up in, and live in, there are elements around you that are harmful to you, and affect you in a negative manner.

In dealing with other people, we often encounter negativity in many dimensions, whether it is in attitude, verbally, or physically.

And in our own actions, we ourselves will have negative attributes that are presented and may affect our co-workers, team mates, as well as friends and family.
