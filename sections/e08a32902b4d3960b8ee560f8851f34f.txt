### [[2.2.2.1.1.1.1.2: Balance to this.  What can be self-service, and what cant.  PaaS for production, IaaS for development and Ops usage.]]

One goal for an operations team that has decided they want to get the benefits of comprehensive automation is to provide more and more self-service tools to the departments they support.

The benefit for the operations team is that they can remain more focused on improving infrastructure, rather than performing requests that were made by other teams to simply set up, configure and change existing infrastructure.

There is also a spectrum of productivity to this:

Handling Requests <---> Improving Infrastructure

The more of the operational team's resources (time, people) that are committed to processing requests made from outside the team (other departments, higher management), the less time the team is able to work on improving the infrastructure that exists, including improving the ability to handle the incoming requests in the first place.

I have worked in many organizations where the operations team spends nearly all of their time performing requests, and almost no time improving the infrastructure, and as a result the infrastructure becomes more and more fragile as request after request is done in a manner that is not scalable or supportable, but is required to meet business timelines and direction.  In this way the Alignment between all elements of the operational environment becomes worse and worse over time as each one-off request is handled specially and the system becomes more "de facto" and less planned.

Achieving business goals is the reason all departments exist, so this is a good thing, in itself, but it can be performed in a manner where the business begins to not operate efficiently, and eventually starts to fail frequently, causing harm to other business goals, such as customer retention, which effects revenue.

In order to handle requests efficiently, the infrastructure must be one that can reasonably be altered to support this requests, and as the business changes in scale, scope, and direction, this takes either a very well put together operational environment that is made to be changed quickly in these manners (possible, but difficult to assemble, and easy to turn less-functional), or it requires time before requests are done, to prepare the environment, or more time after the requests are done to fix the system after the fact.
