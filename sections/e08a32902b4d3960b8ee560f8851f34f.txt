### [[2.2.2.1.1.1.1.2: Balance to this.  What can be self-service, and what cant.  PaaS for production, IaaS for development and Ops usage.]]

One goal for an operations team that has decided they want to get the benefits of comprehensive automation is to provide more and more self-service tools to the departments they support.

The benefit for the operations team is that they can remain more focused on improving infrastructure, rather than performing requests that were made by other teams to simply set up, configure and change existing infrastructure.

There is also a spectrum of productivity to this:

Handling Requests <---> Improving Infrastructure

The more of the operational team's resources (time, people) that are committed to processing requests made from outside the team (other departments, higher management), the less time the team is able to work on improving the infrastructure that exists, including improving the ability to handle the incoming requests in the first place.

I have worked in many organizations where the operations team spends nearly all of their time performing requests, and almost no time improving the infrastructure, and as a result the infrastructure becomes more and more fragile as request after request is done in a manner that is not scalable or supportable, but is required to meet business timelines and direction.  In this way the Alignment between all elements of the operational environment becomes worse and worse over time as each one-off request is handled specially and the system becomes more "de facto" and less planned.

Achieving business goals is the reason all departments exist, so it is a good thing to get the work done, but if it is performed in a manner where the business begins to operate less efficiently over time, and eventually starts to fail frequently, it can cause harm to other business goals, such as customer retention, which effects revenue.  So both getting the work done, and getting the work done in a way that improves the ability to do more work in the future are important goals which must coexist in an healthy environment.

In order to handle requests efficiently, the infrastructure must be one that can reasonably be altered to support this requests, and as the business changes in scale, scope, and direction, this takes either a very well put together operational environment that is made to be changed quickly in these manners (possible, but difficult to assemble, and easy to turn less-functional), or it requires time before requests are done, to prepare the environment, or more time after the requests are done to fix the system after the fact.

This is also on a spectrum, so you can't have both extremes as being simultaneously true in the same instance, which means you need to acknowledge, plan for and deal with the trade offs actively both over longer periods of times (quarters, years) and for each request, with an understanding of the scope of each requests potential to make positive or negative impacts on the infrastructure.

What do I mean when I say two extreme's can't be true at the same time for the same instance?  Apart from the truism there, what I specifically mean is that an environment that is not flexible must request time to complete requests to stay a healthy environment.  And a team that does not have time to complete request appropriately must have a flexible infrastructure to be able to finish requests without "enough time" to change the infrastructure to keep it healthy.  So either the team must have time, or the team must not need to have time, in order to keep the infrastructure healthy.

Failure to either get enough time per request, or to have an infrastructure that does not take much time per request to stay healthy, will result in an operational environment that becomes unhealthy, and will begin to exhibit the unhealthy signs:  Lower Availability, Lower Performance, Lower Correctness, Lower User Satisfaction, etc.

This spectrum is fairly specific, unlike things like "Not Available <--> Available", which is a fairly straight-forward concept to understand in a single topic, this axis' line moves among many topics to create a sliding scale between all of them, in a very limited manner.

Trade Off Between Team Time and Infrastructure Flexibility For A Healthy Environment:

Team Has Time To Manually Perform Requests <---> Infrastructure Is Flexible Enough To Take Requests Quickly Without Requiring Significant Team Manual Time

This flexibility to be very specific with an axis, and to cross many boundaries of topics provides another benefit to Axiomatic Engineering, which is that "Contrast and Compare" type efforts can be very explicit, and anything that is too complicated to talk about clearly can be turned into these very specific sets of axises, which can than be given numerical values, and compared against each other.

Because the topics are specific, and the numerical values gives your preference (or data if automated values through automatic monitoring collection) for what these very specific things should be, and if you have related concepts that are specifically explained in contrasting axises, then the resulting quantified numbers of those axises can give deeper insight to the problem, and can be communicated.
