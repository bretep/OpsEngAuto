### [[2.4.2: Slicing the Pie vs Aggregation]]

In the last section we covered the importance of slicing with the Philosopher's Knife without losing any information.

One easy way of thinking about this is that you are cutting up a pie with the Philosopher's Knife.

No matter how you slice a pie, the amount of pie has not been reduced.

If you cut a piece directly down the middle, creating 2 symmetrical pieces, no pie is lost.  You have 2 pieces that compose the entire pie before slicing.

Similarly if you cut a pie into any configuration, with any number of cuts, whether it is symmetrical, asymmetrical, whether the cuts are vertical, horizontal, diagonal, straight or wavy, the results are the same, in total all the pieces still contain all the original matter of the pie, the difference is only in the distinction of between separate pieces of the pie.

In our philosophical cuts, the structure of the "pie" does not change, unlike a real pie, which deforms with the pressure of cuts, and will turn into a mess after enough slicing.

In our virtual "pies" of information, or systems, we can slice any number of times in any direction, and the information remains the same, but on each side of the cut, we have made a division that can be used logically.

For instance, we can look at an Operating System that runs on hardware (like Linux, OS X or Windows), and divide the it into code that runs in "Kernel space" vs code that runs in "User space".

This divides all code that is executed from the operating system.  We can take the same system, and make a cut between "firmware" (code that executes from BIOS and other places closer to hardware) and "software", which is executed from RAM on the main CPU.

Whether we have divided by "Kernel vs User" or "Firmware vs Software", nothing about the system has changed, we have simply decided to cut the pie in a different place, and we can then use this division for some sort of useful inspection.

Cuts can be layered on top of each other, like dividing into Firmware/Software, and then dividing Software into Kernel/User space, and could continue to be divided, such as dividing User space into shared library code vs. application local code.  Share library code will be executed by more than one application, and is stored in a .so or .dll type file, and application code will be stored in a program's ELF or EXE formatted binary file.

For purposes of discussion and illustration we can be fairly fluid about our definitions, and decisions on where to slice, because they are throw-away examples, and exist only for as long as they are useful to us.

As we get deeper into the topics of Engineering Axioms and automation, we will see that while this can be used fluidly, the ability to use it deterministically, in a repeatable pattern, across many topics, becomes of paramount importance.

The reason for this is the difference between a comprehensive system (correctly sliced with the philosophers knife), and an aggregated system, which is built not as a complete system that is sliced into pieces of the pie that can be put together to form the whole, but is aggregated from components.

The problem with aggregated "systems" is that they not always in jeopardy of becoming not-internally-consistent.  Due to being "aggregated" into creation, where one piece is created, and then another piece, and then the two are put together, and then a change is made, and then a new piece is added, you get the result of not having a "complete pie" when it is resembled.  

Aggregated systems have a tendency towards not being internally consistent, and Comprehensive (Slicing the Pie) systems have a tendency towards being internally consistent.  Just because you have a Comprehensive (Slicing the Pie) system, does not mean you cannot create an a situation where it isn't internally consistent, but as it is reviewed and worked on (under the Slicing-The-Pie mechanism), it will be revealed as to where and why an internal-consistency-error was created.  In an aggregated system this is much more difficult, because things are only related to their adjacent neighbors through their connections, and did not come out of a comprehensive system from the beginning.

In fact, I will attempt to prove later on that it is impossible for a system that is aggregated to ever become a complete and comprehensive system, whereas if you always work from the method of "slicing the pie", you will always have a comprehensive system.  The reason for this is their approach.  

The work involved to do both are very similar, and in some cases exactly the same, but the manner of thinking about the elements in them are very different, and yield very different results.

If you think about "comprehensiveness" as "volume", and we think of the "space of this volume" as a rectangle (width and height), then the Aggregation method works by building up from the bottom (height = 0, and up), and works along the width to provide more structure.  

The Comprehensive model starts by utilizing the entire area of the volume, but making subdivisions, say in 4 equal pieces to start, and assigning each sub-section as an element of the Comprehensive whole.  Then those sub-sections are subdivided again, and again, until we start to add in details.  The entirety of the volume will never be filled, as there is an infinite amount of detail that can be applied, but the entire space of the rectangle is being "owned" by some topic, and is being further divided down as we zoom-in to more details.

With the Aggregate model (which is a system, but not in the "Systemic Thinking" sense of the word), only the bottom parts of the space are utilized.  It's doing the same thing, in terms of implementation of the details, but the way the details are mapped to one-another is only through their implementation.  This differs from the Comprehensive model (which uses "system" in the same way the "Systemic Thinking" does), because the relationship for all details is completely mapped into the entire volume, the entire comprehensive structure of thought or description, and the model takes into account "all of the space", even if a given particular part of the space has not yet been implemented.

The Aggregate model does not have the attributes, and so gives a different result, which is not a Comprehensive result, but a "de facto" result.

As of 2015, I do not know of any operational environments which work in a manner that is consistent with "slicing the pie" vs aggregation.  I will explain this assertion as we get more into details, but this puts the use of systemic thinking in an operational environment into a purely "mythical" state at the moment.

Part of the purpose of this book is to provide a path for others to understand these differences, so that paths can be built to allow us to create these comprehensive and complete systems, and to manage them accordingly, to get the benefits which they provide.

We know the benefits and fallbacks of the aggregation system, though without comparing them to another method it is merely the de facto operations of all environments.  Making a change requires both defining the goals we want to achieve, and the current state of things, to know what is required to make a change to get to our goals.
