### [[10.8.1: "Best Practices" Means Not-Thinking]]

Everyone wants to know a "good" way to do something, or better yet a "better" way of doing something, or best yet, the "best" way of doing something.

And so, "Best Practices" were created, to be sold by authorities (of any type or experience level) as to what you should do under a given situation, often with little context at all in terms of pros-and-cons of the implementation, because the authors often have very little personal experience in managing the solution being offered.

Why would I broadly declare this to be true?  Because for any given "best" solution to be published would require more caveats and warnings than any advice, because "best" is a very specific set of criteria, and they by definition are not taking any of your specific environmental issues into account.

Why would I broadly state that this is tantamount to Not Thinking?  Because if one does not take into account one's specific environment, requirements, resources and goals into consideration in making plans for action, than what is one doing?

It is following a recipe, without checking if the recipe will even give you what you want.  Do you even know what you want?  Probably only vaguely if you want to follow someone else's Best Practices, because you are leaving all the decision making as to what the effects of the system will be up to someone who doesn't know you, your circumstances, your environment, your requirements, your resoureces or your goals.
