### [[3.10.1.1: Evaluate the environment.  Know the present.  Real vs. virtual/logical.]]

Do you remember the term "Knowability", which I introduced towards the beginning of the book?

If not, please refresh your memory quickly here, because it's about to become very useful:  {{ section__knowability }}

In order to make efficient use of our resources, we must understand our resources, in as much depth as possible, in as many categories as possible, for our given cost-benefit requirements, to meet our goals.  So, we want to know "almost everything about everything", while trying to minimize that into as few things as possible, because keeping track of more things is more work than keeping track of less things, and so is less efficient.

The most important thing to know about our Environment is the "Present State".  This is the current state of affairs, for everything, as it actually is.  Reality.

When we previously inspected Knowability, as a concept, we stated that "reality is not truly knowable", because there is so much about any physical thing that we simply cannot measure.

So, what we have left is what we can measure, and with these things we will attempt to "know the present".

Knowing the "past" is as simple as having snapshots of your "present" still available after time.  So any data that is Versioned, or stored in a Time Series, can be used to compare against the Present or other Past Snapshots.

We can think of any of these time slices, moments in time, as a "Snapshot" of all the data of our Environment.  With all these data points from "now" and the past, we can understand where we came from and where we are.

We can further extrapolate, by various statistical means, projections of how things will be over time.  Some things we extrapolate are valid, and useful information, other things we can extrapolate, but they are actually invalid, in that while the mathematics used to calculate them may be valid, the application of that processing against the given data set, for our desired results is not a valid combination.  

This is important to know, as you can predict somethings, such as "How many hard disks do we expect to fail next month?", but you cannot predict other things such as "Will this specific hard drive in this specific machine, fail next month?".  No amount of statistical analysis can answer a useful boolean value there, and a non-boolean result is not something you can reliably make a decision on in that case.

For example, for a given machine and hard disk device, will knowing it's manufacturing lot number, with the known MTBFs (Mean Time Between Failures), and the lifespan of the system, and the usage of the disk (IOPS over time), be able to determine if you must replace that exact hard disk device, in the next month?

No.  That specific hard disk device could fail in the next second, or could last another 5 years, you cannot give an actionable answer to this question.

However, if we restate the question as, "How many disks do I need to have in stock, in order to replace the number of disks in all of my systems that are likely to fail in the next month?"

This is a very different question, because it deals with a population of disk devices, not a single disk device.  Across a population these statistical analysis becomes valid, and it will remain statistically-true, as long as the numbers you give it are accurate and correlate properly, which becomes more true as the population size increases.

So, with the Physical hardware and other Real things, we cannot know everything, but with Virtual things: Data and Logic, we can know everything.

We can gather the exact values for each of the things we wish to know, and we can store them exactly as how they live in the real world, or can digest them so that we store a reference or reference count, or we can do anything else we want with them, because they are Virtual, we can know them completely.

Only the Knowability scale, Virtual information is Knowable at 1.0: Completely Knowable.

Thought experiment: What do you currently know about your own environment?  What don't you know?  What did you think you knew before you read this, but changed your mind as you read?

How can you use this perspective to improve your efficient use of your resources?
