### [[3.3.2.1: Impersonal decision making through communicated values and priorities using Axioms]]

One of the immediate benefits that we can apply to our everyday jobs is to use these Axioms, and their component Attribute Axes and Priorities to determine what actions we should take, and do so in a non-personal way.

These days, when I make decisions, I don't do it because "I want to do X" or "I think X is a good idea", or "I had problems when I do Y, so I do X instead".

I make decisions based on turning things into component pieces, evaluating them, and determining what action best aligns with all of the values.

One course of action better fits those values than another course of action, and that is the action I advocate, and I attempt to use the internal variables for doing that analysis in my explanation of why this is my current position.

Change any variable, and the answer may change.
