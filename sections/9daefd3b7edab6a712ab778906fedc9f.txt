### [[3.3.2.1: Impersonal decision making through communicated values and priorities using Axioms]]

One of the immediate benefits that we can apply to our everyday jobs is to use these Axioms, and their component Attribute Axes and Priorities to determine what actions we should take, and do so in a non-personal way.

These days, when I make decisions, I don't do it because "I want to do X" or "I think X is a good idea", or "I had problems when I do Y, so I do X instead".

I make decisions based on turning things into component pieces, evaluating them, and determining what action best aligns with all of the values (Alignment).

One course of action better fits those values than another course of action, and that is the action I advocate, and I attempt to use the internal variables for doing that analysis in my explanation of why this is my current position.

Change any variable, and the answer may change.

As a thought experiment to visualize this, I like to imagine a scale, like the "Scales of Justice" or an old weight scale where you have 2 sides, and you put a known weight on one side, and the thing you are trying to weight on the other side.  

Since this is not a digital or a single-downward-vector scale (as we generally use these days), but a lever-based scale (I don't actually know the technical terms for these scales, so just making up what makes sense to me), it has two sides, and not just a single platform.

So, we have this old-style scale.  And on the weighing platforms on that scale, sit 2 more scales.

Each one the same type of scale as each other (you can imagine them smaller than the first, so they fit), so that now there are 3 scales

The first scale weighs the 2 scales that sit on it's 2 platforms.  Initially these will all be exactly equal, so no tipping of the scales.

On the 2 scales sitting on the primary scale, there are 2 more scales for each scale.  So 1 base scale (Level 1), 2 scales on the base scale (Level 2), and 4 scales on the 2nd-tier scales (Level 3).

And so on, forever.  A recursive amount of scales placed on scales.

The primary scale is our question:  Do we do "A" or "B"?  One side of the scale represents "A" and the other "B".

Sub-dividing our question into Prioritized Attribute Axes, they map to the layers of the scales.  

We can also use this with our "90%-9%-0.9%" rule:  Level 1 is our Top Priority (90%).  Level 2 is next priority (9%).  Level 3 is our next (0.9%), and so on.

Having a "Recursive Tree of Scales" in which I map all my values to, means that any time a value changes, the entire tree will need to rebalance.

If the "A" side was heavier, but something is removed and added to the "B" side, or something was merely made heavier on the "B" side, then the scale will tip.  Maybe it won't go all the way over to being "Fully-Weighted-On-B", but it will be "Less-Weighted-On-A" than it was before.

This imaginary set of scales is always working in my mind as I rate the various axes that my organization or goals are concerned with, and as changes are proposed, I re-scale my values, and the Recursive Scale rebalances itself.

In this way, I am not really making any decision at all, personally, I am merely an agent of this system, mapping values as I understand them into a set of Prioritized Attribute Axes, which map to goals, which map to a result (effects) that we want, and when any variable changes, the results might change.

This doesn't mean that I don't bring my experience into the picture, because I do, but my experience is mapped into this Attribute Axes and Priorities, and can be expressed in a deterministic and explicit manner.

They can be written into a Data Source and evaluated by Logic, and they can be graphed, statistically analyzed and revision controlled for historical reference.

This is how I make judgement calls in a "non-personal" way, and I assert that this is a valid way to proceed with making Engineering decisions.
