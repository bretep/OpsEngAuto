### [[3.3.2.1: Impersonal decision making through communicated values and priorities using Axioms]]

One of the immediate benefits that we can apply to our everyday jobs is to use these Axioms, and their component Attribute Axes and Priorities to determine what actions we should take, and do so in a non-personal way.

These days, when I make decisions, I don't do it because "I want to do X" or "I think X is a good idea", or "I had problems when I do Y, so I do X instead".

I make decisions based on turning things into component pieces, evaluating them, and determining what action best aligns with all of the values.

One course of action better fits those values than another course of action, and that is the action I advocate, and I attempt to use the internal variables for doing that analysis in my explanation of why this is my current position.

Change any variable, and the answer may change.

As a thought experiment to visualize this, I like to imagine a scale, like the "Scales of Justice" or an old weight scale where you have 2 sides, and you put a known weight on one side, and the thing you are trying to weight on the other side.  

Since this is not a digital or a downward-vector scale (as we generally use these days), but a lever or fulcrum scale (I don't actually know the technical terms for these scales, so just making up what makes sense to me), 

So, we have this old-style scale.  And on the weighing platforms on that scale, sit 2 more scales.

Each one the same type of scale as each other (you can imagine them smaller than the first, so they fit), so that now there are 3 scales

The first scale weighs the 2 scales that sit on it's 2 platforms.  Initially these will all be exactly equal, so no tipping of the scales.

On the 2 scales sitting on the primary scale, there are 2 more scales for each scales.  So 1 base scale, 2 scales on the base scale, and 4 scales on the 2nd-tier scales.

And so on, forever.  A recursive amount of scales on scales.

The primary scale is our question:  Do we do "A" or "B"?  One side of the scale represents "A" and the other "B".

Sub-dividing our question into Prioritized Attribute Axes, they map to the layers of the scales.

Having a "Recursive Tree of Scales" in which I map all my values to, means that any time a
