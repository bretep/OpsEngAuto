### [[2.2.2.1.1.1: Typically companies still dont tell ops departments that they need anything, until its due, all decisions are done, and its time to roll out.]]

The problem of communication between departments, especially in regard to lead times between knowing they need work to eventually be done, and when they alert another department or team that they need that work done is such a classic problem that we can just assume it will happen everywhere, in every circumstance, unless people do something to change the pattern.

In places where departments are giving each other prior notice of work coming down the pipeline, and involving the teams they will need to do that future work in the design phase, it is very likely that this was set up on purpose, and either by "visionary" early employees or founders, or through great work of some individuals to make changes to the de facto process of only asking for work to be done, when it is at the end of the project and time to release.

I say it's most likely that this is the problem, because I have only worked in a couple environments, out of a large number of environments, where this happened as a normal occurrence.

The point I am making is that one shouldn't be surprised when another department or group arrives and says they have finished a project, and they "just need it deployed into production", and has no time available in their release schedule for doing things like:

- Productionizing the release process
- Productionizing the configuration
- Doing security audits and fixes
- Writing an operational manual with support play book, enumeration of error codes, instructions as to options

Frequently projects just being released into production do not have good performance tests done of them, although this happens more frequently than others, so I'm not including it in the above list.

One of the lessons it took me a very long time to learn, but has served me well since learning it, is that if you recognize a pattern as occurring regularly, it is better to simply plan to deal with that pattern than to put up any resistance to it's existence.

What I mean by this is not to get upset when you are given these types of projects, and they require immediate action, and things are requested to be done "wrong" and they cause havoc with the clean environment you are trying to make.

Instead, see them as failure to get ahead of a pattern that occurs so frequently that you can simply assume that there are cases in process of coming to you right now.

Knowing this, how do you get ahead of this problem?  You can't completely solve it, as it requires cooperation from other people, and the root of the problem is that they themselves aren't coming forward to cooperate before they normally would.

Some things you can do:

- Regularly, say every month, send out a standard template communication (email, etc) to all departments asking if they have any projects that will coming down the pipeline and will need operational resources.

- Describe in the communication what "requires operational resources" means, such as machines in production, adding a new service, making changes to services which aren't already in production or that the operations department doesn't know about, etc.

- Describe any lead-times you require for these types of projects.

This is the direct-but-passive communication approach, and will allow people who are up for communicating ahead of time to communicate with you in a way they can understand is helpful.  This will not catch all new projects.

From there you can also create a department policy, document it in your online documentation site (wiki, etc) as to how you accept new projects, and when people ask you for them,  you can refer them to the "new project on-boarding" documentation that describes how you would like to work.

This provides some "back end" type protections, as people will see that they didn't communicate with your regular email, and now they are learning how the operations department works.

But this will still not stop any externally set schedules, as if the company requires a product is launched on a given date, then this is a higher priority than following any department's self-appointed rules, and will override them in many circumstances.

The direct-active approach is the best, but requires more resources, this would be someone who is acting a department project manager would meet with the other department heads or team managers directly, and ask them what they are working on, and when they will need operational resources.

This direct-active approach is more likely to be successful, as the managers will know what projects they are working on, and are not trying to hide their project's work, they are simply working to complete their projects, and in this way you are assisting them in getting to the final steps of completion.

If this can be approached in a "let us help you" manner, then collaboration can begin, and hopefully will improve the working conditions for everyone, as handing off work between groups is a difficult process.
