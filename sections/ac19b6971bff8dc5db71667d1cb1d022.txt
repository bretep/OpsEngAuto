### [[3.13: Structure as Logic]]

Explain how I use schema and other structures in place of Logic, reducing the total amount of Logic, and making the gap between working features and Logic-creation much smaller.

How this scales better than not doing this, writing everything as Logic without help from Structure.

Structure is Efficient Alignment, in practice.
