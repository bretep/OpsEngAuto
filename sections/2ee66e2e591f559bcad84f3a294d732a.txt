### [[3.1.1: A brief interlude on the Strengths and Weaknesses of Metaphors]]

There is a trade-off on Metaphors, and is has to do with expert-knowledge and accuracy.

Metaphors, in my opinion, are most useful when are you not an expert on the subject of the metaphor, or defer your expertise to see the metaphorical example being used as tool for communication.

If I give the example of:

 "Production Operations must deal with the problems given by information alignment and physical hardware management, similar to how building a bridge must deal with the soil, water, wind and temperatures around a bridge, and the materials used to construct the bridge."

This metaphor, or simile in this case, is most useful if the audience are not experts at building bridges.  As an expert in building a bridge, they may have a very different take on what it takes to build a bridge, and what the issues are, and they may validly complain about my use of analogy between information and soil.

This is where metaphors are weak, because they are meant to give "a comparative idea" by taking us out of the details we are currently immersed, and putting us into a "very loose" frame in another topic which we can discuss as non-experts.

Because of this, it may be useful to change metaphorical topics if someone introduces details about the metaphor which derail the intention of using a metaphor.

If you find yourself disagreeing with a particular metaphorical usage, try to re-frame the metaphor yourself into a different topic, preferably one you do not have expert knowledge in, and see if you can gain more insight into it that way instead.  

The curse of an expert is a real thing, and doesn't just ruin movie plots ("We are 10 digits into hacking the mainframe password, but they are using 49-bit encryption, it will take two more hours.  You need it done in 10 minutes?  We'll make it happen."), but also can ruin the intention of any type of alternative explanation, which is trying to expand on an idea in a hand-wavy-kind-of-way.

This is an attempt to get you to use more information that is being provided, which you already internally know, instead of explicitly providing all the information.  People are great at filling in this information, and while this works best in spoken conversations (say, where you could finish the other person's sentence), metaphors are an attempt to do that explicitly by providing a non-related but comparable reference.
