### [[3.1.1: A brief interlude on the Strengths and Weaknesses of Metaphors]]

There is a trade-off on Metaphors, and it has to do with expert-knowledge and accuracy.

Metaphors, in my opinion, are most useful when are you not an expert on the subject of the metaphor, or defer your expertise to see the metaphorical example being used as tool for communication.

If I give the example of:

 "Production Operations must deal with the problems given by information alignment and physical hardware management, similar to how building a bridge must deal with the soil, water, wind and temperatures around a bridge, and the materials used to construct the bridge."

This metaphor, or simile in this case, is most useful if the audience are not experts at building bridges.  As an expert in building a bridge, they may have a very different take on what it takes to build a bridge, and what the issues are, and they may validly complain about my use of analogy between information and soil.

This is where metaphors are weak, because they are meant to give "a comparative idea" by taking us out of the details we are currently immersed in, and putting us into a "very loose" frame in another topic which we can discuss as non-experts.  In a sense this "levels the playing field", as neither party is an expert at bridge building, so we can use that to illustrate our points of view without getting into details where we do have expertise, but our definitions and values may not be Aligned and need to be discussed.

Because of this, it may be useful to change metaphorical topics if someone introduces details about the metaphor which derail the intention of using a metaphor.  This can be referred to as "over-extending the metaphor".

If you find yourself disagreeing with a particular metaphorical usage, try to re-frame the metaphor yourself into a different topic, preferably one you do not have expert knowledge in, and see if you can gain more insight into it that way instead.  

This can also be a useful tool in determining if you understood someone correctly, as you can re-frame what you understand of their point with a different metaphorical topic, allowing them to re-map what they meant to your new metaphor, and if they are agree, you are both likely thinking of very similar things.  Going back and forth like this, when there is still mis-alignment, choosing new metaphorical topics, or changing the reference of the metaphor, can allow a complex topic to be worked through in a shorter period of time than going to full-fundamental-definitions and working up from there.

The "Expert's Curse" is a real thing, and doesn't just ruin movie plots ("We are 10 digits into hacking the mainframe password, but they are using 49-bit encryption, so it will take two more hours.  You need it done in 10 minutes?  We'll make it happen."), but also can ruin the intention of any type of alternative explanation, which is trying to expand on an idea in a hand-wavy-kind-of-way.

This is an attempt to get you to use more information than what is being provided, which you already internally know, instead of explicitly providing all the information.  People have amazing inherent skills great at filling in this information, and while this works best in spoken conversations (say, where you could finish the other person's sentence), metaphors are an attempt to do that explicitly by providing a non-related but comparable reference.
