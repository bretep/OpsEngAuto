### [[2.6.15: Philosophy]]

If you didn't know, there are 2 Greek roots in the word "Philosophy".

These roots are "love" and "wisdom", so Philosophy is the "love of wisdom".

I look at Wisdom and Intelligence as different axes.

Wisdom is gained from experience, and has to do with the breadth and depth of insight into topics, and being able to make judgements that detail what might be favorable and unfavorable outcomes, and why.

Intelligence I look at in very different perspective, which is "making an action that yields beneficial results for all parties involved."

This is not a common definition of Intelligence, but it has a rigid definition, and comes from a brilliant article written by Carlo M. Cipolla, then a professor of Economics at UC Berkeley, and is one of the greatest things I have ever read, and quite literally changed my life.  I see the world differently after having ingested it.

The article is entitled "The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity", and while it's title and subject matter focus on "Stupidity" (anti-Intelligence), it's real function for me was to qualitatively and quantitatively define what intelligence is.  He puts it on a 2D graph, and charts it, and allows for pinpointing different kinds of Intelligence and Anti-Intelligent actions.  Try not to let the negative sounding name cause you to avoid this information, it is a very important set of thoughts he has encoded there-in.

These start to illustrate the differences between Intelligence and Wisdom, to me, and will hopefully (over the course of the material) become clearer and useful to you as well.

So Philosophy is the "love of wisdom", and I love wisdom, so I take it for that.  I orient myself on "Applied Philosophy", which is Philosophy in a way that I can use to achieve results (internally and externally) and not merely as a way to win arguments at dinner parties, or making comments that end with "Do you want fries with that?".  

Another purpose of Philosophy is to be a structure around the question, "Why?"

In much of Engineering we focus on "How?":

- How do I use this library or software?
- How was this software written?
- How do I get the result I want?

Philosophy is more angled like:

- Why should I use this library instead of that other library?  How are they different?  What will be the effect of using the one, versus the other?  If one of them is better suited for my current situation, but the other may be better suited to a future situation of mine, when would be the time to start switching over?  Is it worth doing?  Should we even be doing any of this at all?

- Why was the software written in this way?  How was the developer trying to allow me to solve problems with it?  How can I best use this software to work with the way the developer was trying to enable me to solve a problem?  Between the different ways I could do this work, what are the different effects they will cause, and which of those do I think will be most beneficial for me?

- Why am I doing this?  What are my goals?  How can I define them precisely?  Is my entire team in agreement with this, as an intention?  Are we able to communicate effectively, ensuring that we understand each other and can work together efficiently?  How would know if this is true, and we are succeeding?  How can we measure that success, and compare it to the goals we wanted to achieve before we started?

Philosophy is about depth, and the ability to inspect things from different angles, and while it may appear on the surface (and is sometimes explicitly stated) that it is trying to "define the way things are", in actuality the Philosophical inspection never ends (Infinitely Recursive), and so it does not have the ability to ever define things "the way they are", because it can't stop defining things.

This is a "Turing Machine" in which we know it will never halt.  There is no final exit or return from Philosophy, it is a rabbit hole that never ends, and goes as deep as you are willing to look, and the detail expands to meet any closer inspection.  What is true from one perspective, or frame of values, is false from another.  It's flexibility to reframe data is infinite.

I think Philosophy has a bad-wrap these days, and I hope to show, if only in a thin slice, that there is a way to use Philosophical ideas in a practical way to add clarity and improved performance in your life and work.

Transitioning back to Wisdom (Note to self: Awesome segue!):

One simple way to see Wisdom is "good ideas".

To keep things simple and say, "I love good ideas", is why I love and heavily utilitize methods of philosophy.  I make use of different kinds of philosophies in my own ways, I take their definitions and interpret them in my own meanings, and I mix and match pieces wherever I need to as configurable tools to be used in understanding the problem I have at hand, and manipulating it into what I what I want it to become, to get the results I want.

This is what philosophy is an element of, for me, and in this book, it will be how I will go about using it, and referencing it.
