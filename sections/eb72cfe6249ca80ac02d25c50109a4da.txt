### [[2.6.15: Philosophy]]

If you didn't know, there are 2 Greek roots in the word "Philosophy".

These roots are "love" and "wisdom", so Philosophy is the "love of wisdom".

I look at Wisdom and Intelligence as different axes.

Wisdom is gained from experience, and has to do with the breadth and depth of insight into topics, and being able to make judgements that detail what might be favorable and unfavorable outcomes, and why.

Intelligence I look at in very different perspective, which is "making an action that yields beneficial results for all parties involved."

This is not a common definition of Intelligence, but it has a rigid definition, and comes from a brilliant article written by Carlo M. Cipolla, a professor of Economics at UC Berkeley, and is one of the greatest things I have ever read, and quite literally changed my life.  I see the world differently after having ingested it.

The article is entitled "The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity", and while it's title and subject matter focus on "Stupidity" (anti-Intelligence), it's real function for me was to qualitatively and quantitatively define what intelligence is.  He puts it on a 2D graph, and charts it, and allows for pinpointing different kinds of Intelligence and Anti-Intelligent actions.  Try not to let the negativity sounding name cause you to avoid this information, it is a very important set of thoughts he has encoded there-in.

These start to illustrate the differences between Intelligence and Wisdom, to me, and will hopefully (over the course of the material) become clearer and useful to you as well.

So Philosophy is the "love of wisdom", and I love wisdom, so I take it for that.  I orient myself on "Applied Philosophy", which is Philosophy in a way that I can use to achieve results (internally and externally) and not merely as a way to win arguments at dinner parties, or making comments that end with "Do you want fries with that?".  

Another purpose of Philosophy is to be a structure around the question, "Why?"

In much of Engineering we focus on "How?":

- How do I use this library or software?
- How was this software written?
- How do I get the result I want?

I think Philosophy has a bad-wrap these days, and I hope to show, if only in a thin slice, that there is a way to use Philosophical ideas in a practical way to add clarity and improved performance in your life and work.

One simply way to see Wisdom is "good ideas".

To keep things simple and say, "I love good ideas", is why I love and heavily utilitize methods of philosophy.  I make use of different kinds of philosophies in my own ways, I take their definitions and interpret them in my own meanings, and I mix and match pieces wherever I need to as configurable tools to be used in understanding the problem I have at hand, and manipulating it into what I what I want it to become, to get the results I want.

This is what philosophy is an element of, for me, and in this book, it will be how I will go about using it, and referencing it.
