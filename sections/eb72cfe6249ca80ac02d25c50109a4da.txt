### [[2.6.15: Philosophy]]

If you didn't know, there are 2 Greek roots in the word "Philosophy".

These roots are "love" and "wisdom", so Philosophy is the "love of wisdom".

I look at Wisdom and Intelligence as different axes.

Wisdom is the gained from experience, and how to do with the breadth and depth of insight into topics, and being able to make judgements that detail what might be favorable and unfavorable outcomes.

Intelligence I look at in very different perspective, which is "making an action that yields beneficial results for all parties involved."

This is not a common definition of Intelligence, but it has a rigid definition, and comes from a brilliant article written by Carlo M. Cipolla, a professor of Economics at UC Berkeley, and is one of the greatest things I have ever read, and quite literally changed my life.  I see the world differently after having ingested it.

The article is entitled "The Basic Laws of Human Stupidity", and while it's title and subject matter focus on "Stupidity" (anti-Intelligence), it's real function for me was to qualitatively and quantitatively define what intelligence is.  He puts it on a 2D graph, and charts it, and allows for pinpointing different kinds of Intelligence and Anti-Intelligent actions.
