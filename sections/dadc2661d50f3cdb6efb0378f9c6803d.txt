### [[2.5.4: Inputs, Outputs and Side-Effects: A Virtual Mechanism]]

I talk about the qualities of "Inputs, Outputs and Side-Effects" enough that I've decided to label them as something that can be discussed directly.

I will call something that takes Inputs, gives Outputs, and produces Side-Effects a "Universal Machine", because it is a type of machine (performs work, mechanistically), and can be applied in any situation.  It may be a deterministic machine or non-deterministic (introduces randomness, or other factors which cause different Outputs or Side-Effects with the same Inputs).

A Universal Machine, by our definition here, can take any inputs and return any outputs, and create any side-effects, whether they are Real or Virtual, it doesn't matter.  The important aspect is that there is a definition of the interface, so that the understanding can be brought about from just looking at Inputs, Outputs and Side-Effects.

Additionally, how you define a Universal Machine can change based on your goals.  If you are trying to track information as input, and information as output, and yet track real physical changes as side-effects, this is one way of defining a machine.  In a different way, for the same situation, you could define physical inputs, and physical outputs, and information-based side-effects (data that has changed).  Any combination is usable.  In the Operations world, generally we are dealing with informational inputs, informational outputs and informational side-effects, as physical changes are usually outside of our area of immediate concerns.

A Universal Machine can be defined as you want it, and can be applied to anything, like a system, and a Universal Machine is a System, but it is a specific type of System that is defined as having Inputs, Outputs and Side-Effects.

Any process, physical or non-physical (informational, virtual, etc), can be defined by it's Inputs, Outputs and Side-Effects, so this creates an interface we can use at any time, for any reason, and we can reason about Universal Machines based on their interfaces, separate from the work that they actually perform.

The linkages between Universal Machines will follow the same rules, irregardless of the type of Inputs, Outputs and Side-Effects being worked on.  By making a distinct type of unit we can refer to by the label Universal Machine, we can always drop into the method of talking about a component. or service, or physical machine, or any type of thing, and how it operates in a chain or process of events.
