### [[2.5.4: Inputs, Outputs and Side-Effects: A Virtual Mechanism]]

I talk about the qualities of "Inputs, Outputs and Side-Effects" enough that I've decided to label them as something that can be discussed in themselves.

I will call something that takes Inputs, gives Outputs, and produces Side-Effects a "Universal Machine", because it is a type of machine (performs work, mechanistically).  It may be a deterministic machine or non-deterministic (introduces randomness, or other factors which cause different Outputs or Side-Effects with the same Inputs.
