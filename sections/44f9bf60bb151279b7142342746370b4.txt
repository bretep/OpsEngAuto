### [[11.12: Randomly Collected Spectrums]]

Spectrums I thought of, but have not yet placed in a particular part of the book.


Spectrum: Caring

Shame <=====> Pride

Without caring about things, one cannot feel shame over bad actions, nor price in good actions.  This is an effect of having an environment where the care-takers do not care about their environment, only about getting through another day.

When you care, you will avoid creating Shame for yourself and others.  When you care, you will try to perform actions you and others can be Proud of.  These are good things, because they will form as a compass, pointing in the direction you want to go towards and away from.
