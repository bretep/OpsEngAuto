### [[2.6.6: Knowability]]

I didn't know this before I just looked it up, but Knowability is already a word in dictionaries, so there is not a lot of reason to cover it in depth.

We've already been using it quite a lot, but I thought it would make sense to shortly define it.

Knowability is a spectrum of how well you can know something, in full, at all levels.  It needs to be extreme knowledge like our "X=5" example, where we know absolutely everything about it.

Any ambiguity or aspects that remain not-perfectly-knowable need to count against it being on the extreme side of Knowability, and more towards the side of Unknowability.

To set up the spectrum, it looks like this:

Unknowable  <--->  Knowable
