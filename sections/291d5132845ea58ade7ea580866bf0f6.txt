### [[3.9: When to use statistics.  When they are applicable, when they are not.]]



When I started this book I made some statistical counters, which are sections, words and lines written.

I estimated from about 280 sections off of my first 10 sections written, that I would have about 208,000 words at the end of the book.

I have been checking my percentage complete, such as currently:

"""
 Total Sections: 301 Populated Sections: 54 Current Goal: Populate Empty Sections: 247 (Done: 17.9%)

Lines: 2197

Words: 37668
"""

And the sections and word percentages to completion have almost kept perfect alignment the entire time I have been writing this work.

Yesterday was:

>>> 33000 / 200000.
0.165

And today (with the above quote):

>>> 37600 / 200000.
0.188

18.8% word vs 17.9% sections, in terms of estimated complete.

Additionally I have been adding sections and removing them as I see fit.  Im not trying to match this data up, and Im not trying to count words in my sections, I just write what seems to fill the topic section, and move on.

And yet the percentage complete to my initial rough-calculation of 208,000 words, remaining in-line with the number of sections I have.  I will do an analysis on this from my Github entries, since all of this is in version control once the book is done.

This is a topic that apparently works very well with statistical analysis, and the results are "amazingly accurate" as a study of the population of words and sections I write over time.

Apparently there is some kind of statistical slant I have to writing a certain number of words a day, a certain number of sections a day, and so on.
