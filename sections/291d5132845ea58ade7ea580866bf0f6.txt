### [[3.9: When to use statistics.  When they are applicable, when they are not.]]



When I started this book I made some statistical counters, which are sections, words and lines written.

I estimated from about 280 sections off of my first 10 sections written, that I would have about 208,000 words at the end of the book.

I have been checking my percentage complete, such as currently:

"""
 Total Sections: 301 Populated Sections: 54 Current Goal: Populate Empty Sections: 247 (Done: 17.9%)

Lines: 2197

Words: 37668
"""

And the sections and word percentages to completion have almost kept perfect alignment the entire time I have been writing this work.

Yesterday was:

0.165

And today (with the above quote):
