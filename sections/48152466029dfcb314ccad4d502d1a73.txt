### [[Chapter 1: Preface]]

What will you get out of this book?  Why read it?

What I hope to impart here is a view into how I see operations, and how I automate operations.

In the case of this book, "operations" means "networked operations", "server operations", "datacenter operations", "production operations", all rolled into one term.  The name is both specific and non-specific, as operations can mean other things, but these specific fields are what I'm referring to.

What I hope you will gain from my perspective is a new foundation you can use as a plane of reference to improve your own operational mindset and practices, whether you are already an experienced operations engineer or new to the field. 

I will be covering a large arena of information, and I will try to present a coherent picture, though each section must unfortunately be left incomplete as each section is only a small part of the larger picture I am trying to make clear.  This is in contrast to many technical books which explain things clearly in each section before moving on, because their content is able to be defined and explained in each given section.

This book's format is meant to be read from start to finish.  It starts off more general, and philosophical, setting up terminology and direction.  Then it becomes more specific as we work towards implementation.  Finally, it will go back to being more general as we discuss how to implement in your current environment, as automation will change the way your organization operates, and must be performed with these issues in mind.

This book is more about depth than breadth, and as such we will continue to come back to examples over and over again, looking at them in different ways, to give a deeper understanding of all the components that make them up.  This is in contrast to many books that are meant to describe an array of information and give you a broader understanding of how to work and how to use them specifically.
