### [[Chapter 1: Preface]]

What will you get out of this book?  Why read it?

What I hope to impart here is a view into how I see operations, and how I automate operations.

In the case of this book, "operations" means "networked operations", "server operations", "datacenter operations", "production operations", all rolled into one term.  The field is both specific and non-specific, as operations can mean other things, but these fields are what I'm referring to.

What I hope you will gain from my perspective is a new foundation you can use as a point of reference to build your own operations experiences from, whether you are already an experienced operations engineer or new to the field. 

I will be covering a very large arena of information, so I will try to present a coherent picture, even though I cannot go into full details on every aspect, as it covers too many disciplines.

This book's format is meant to be read from start to finish.  It starts off more general, and very philosophical, setting up terminology and scenarios.  Then will become more specific as we get into implementation details.  Finally, it will go back to being more general as we discuss how to implement in your current environment.

This book is more about depth than about breadth, and as such we will continue to come back to examples over and over again, looking at them in different ways, to give a deeper understanding of all the components that make them up.  This is in contrast to many books that are meant to describe an array of information and give you a broader understanding of how to work and how to use them specifically.
