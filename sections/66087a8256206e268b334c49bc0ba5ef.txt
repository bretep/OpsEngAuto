Let's take a brief tangent prioritization.  I gave a couple priority lists earlier, and they were listed sequentially, but not numbered or evaluated in terms of "how much more important" each element was.

There are many ways to rank priorities, and I have come up with a methodology that I like which I call the: "90-9-0.9% rule", and can be said as "Ninety-nine-point-Oh-nine rule" to make that actually pronounceable.
