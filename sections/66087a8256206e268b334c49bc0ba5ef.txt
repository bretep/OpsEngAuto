Let's take a brief tangent prioritization.  I gave a couple priority lists earlier, and they were listed sequentially, but not numbered or evaluated in terms of "how much more important" each element was.

There are many ways to rank priorities, and I have come up with a methodology that I like which I call the: "90-9-0.9% rule", and can be said as "Ninety-nine-point-Oh-nine rule" to make that actually pronounceable.

The progression continues on forever, with the previous item being ten times (10x) more important than it's following item.

This allows for clarity in which thing is more important, and also for knowing when things are just not important any more.  It is purposefully exaggerated because without that clear separation, it is unclear why one action would be preferred over another action, because of "extenuating circumstances" may exaggerate a lower prioritized item over a higher prioritized item.

It is my contention, that you should never do this.  If you are going to change prioritization, you should explicitly change it from the order of ["A, B, C"] to ["B, A, C"] for a given circumstance.  "ABC" may normally be what you want, and in some circumstance "BAC" may be better, and so you should explicitly state that.

But, while evaluating the priorities of "ABC", then "A" should always be preferred over "B", or you should change your assessment of the priorities and state what the extenuating circumstances are for the priority change.  This is for clarity of communication, both with yourself at a later date ("Why did I do that?") and for people besides yourself who should share a common understanding with you.

By making the differences 10x apart, it clarifies things much more than if they were less.  2x may still sufficient, but let us first demonstrate that merely being "too close together" in priority separation causes confusion, and from that we can see that "further apart is less confusion", and have our answer for why this is a valid technique.

Say we have priority of Availability and Performance, and we assign Availability a value of "100" and we assign Performance a value of "90", so that Availability is the most important thing (an "A" grade of importance"), and Performance is the second most, but still highly important (a "B" grade of importance).

So, Availability is first, but Performance is still quite close behind at 10%.

Say there is a decision to be made, and it has to due with a hardware configuration, say cabling, that will give an Availability vs. Performance tradeoff.

Let's say that we can cable up some storage which will be five times (5x) faster in Specification B, but it has as flaw in that sometimes it fails, but very rarely and might be able to be avoided with some maintenance actions.

But, there is another cabling strategy which will ensure Availability, Specification A, even under intense failure scenarios, but is one fifth (1/5th) the speed (Performance) of Specification B.

If we have a 10% different in importance (100 vs 90) in Availability (Spec A) and Performance (Spec B), but we are getting a 5x boost of Performance if we choose Spec B, we have a decision to make, and some data to make it with.

If we were going to seriously evaluate this, for a presentation on "What should we do?" to our department, we could make up some "point system" and do the arithmetic and decide which had more points.  On a scale of 100 vs 90, it is possible that the 5X performance could win the "point comparison" just because of the "5x" scaling value being used in
