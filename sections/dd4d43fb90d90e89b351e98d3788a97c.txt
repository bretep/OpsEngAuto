### [[3.10.1: The use of resources (overall time, people time, money, hardware, etc) to create desired effects, for a given environment.]]

For our purposes, Resources can be summarized to the short list of:

- Overall Time
- Personnel Time
- Money
- Hardware

Overall Time is like calendar time.  Things can take hours, or a month, or the month of March goes by, or something is a quarter of a year.  This is all "overall" time.  It speaks to time passing, which you cannot do-over, making it a limited resource.  This is heavily tied to Money, which is why the saying "Time is money" has a logical truth to it, since salaries, rent and loans must all be paid at distinct time periods, so this is a very important concept for organizations.

Personnel Time is the time that any given person has to perform work.  For instance, in an example job an engineer may have 40 hours of time to potentially perform work in a week.  Over a month that is 160 hours of potential time.  This is also a limited resource, and while organizations can make this flexible by paying more (hourly/bonuses/etc) or by asking for the person to simply give more time (unpaid overtime/death marches/etc), it still mostly remains a very limited resource.

Money is obviously a limited resource as it is a scalar/number.  At any time an organization will have a value for available capital, and another value of available credit, and potentially options for creating more capital (sales/etc) or credit (new lines/etc).  These are all limited resources, and running out of money is almost exclusively the only reason organizations cease to exist, or are otherwise "abandoned".

Hardware is essentially a "platform" for performing work.  We can lump buildings, facilities, hardware-infrastructure, and all other kinds of things into this that are essentially "things we buy/rent with money, that we then 'own' and have to manage".

Apart from these things there are of course other categories, such as Software that we buy (like Hardware), but these days you can run your entire organization on Free Open Source Software (FOSS) and many companies do just that, operating as well or better than those who pay for software.  So, Software is fairly subjective in terms of being a resource like Hardware, as without Hardware we do not have any place to run FOSS or commercial software, and so we cannot operate.

Additionally, engineering companies often create their own software, and this is required for managing your own operational environments, as there will be somethings that are unique about your organization, even if you try to make it as generic as possible, from the software-infrastructure side of things.  

Finally, even commercial software requires configuration, troubleshooting, maintenance, etc, so in comparison with do-it-yourself style software, the difference is only in Personnel Time and Money, and it may well be cheaper to do it either way, depending on your unique situation and goals.

How you use resources will determine the efficiency in the interactions between them, and the overall level of quality and quantity of work that you can perform, which will impact the success of your goals, and the success of your organization.

Using resources efficiently is of prime importance for any Engineer.
