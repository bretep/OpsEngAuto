### [[1.1: Where Ive Been, What Ive Been Doing ]]

As of now (2015), I've been working in the industry for over 20 years, and have been programming for over 30 years.  I've written over 1000 programs of varying size (the bulk of them being smaller, and operational in nature), but have also written and deployed PC games, end-user productivity tools, accounting software, end-user websites, as well as a lot of operations related monitoring, alerting, log parsing, configuration and automation logic required for operations work.

Some names of places I've worked, named where you may know them, and grouped as industries where it's unlikely:

Google, VMWare, Netflix, Cisco, Pacific Telesis, Lawrence Livermore Labs, Mobile Game Companies, PC Game Industry, Mortgage Industry, Financial Security Industry, Internet Startups (SaaS and end-user websites)
