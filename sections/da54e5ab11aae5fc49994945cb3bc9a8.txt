### [[2.5: Terminology]]

Congratulations!  You've made it to the second beginning of the book, where we go over the definitions of terminology we will be using.

I thought it was important to give a bunch of background on what we were going to talk about before we got to the definitions, because my terminology definitions may be quite different than how you already think of these terms.

For the purposes of this book, please accept my definitions as I will use them in this book.  If it helps you can mentally append "Geoff is saying he means X when he says Y in this book", if the terminologies conflict too much with your existing use of the words.

The important part of this is that you gain insight into my perspectives, as I will be using those descriptions of my perspectives to build up a detailed map of how to inspect an environment, how to design and compose an environment, how to implement it, how to automate it, how to troubleshoot it, how to perform maintenance and life-cycle changes to it, how to document it, describe it to other people, etc.

This is all too much to do with just anyone's terminology, and the only terminology that will be able to consistently deliver these results will be my own.  So try to accept all of these for t
