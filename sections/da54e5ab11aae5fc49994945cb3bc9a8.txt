### [[2.5: Terminology]]

Congratulations!  You've made it to the second beginning of the book, where we go over the definitions of terminology we will be using.

I thought it was important to give a bunch of background on what we were going to talk about before we got to the definitions, because my terminology definitions may be quite different than how you already think of these terms, as you may have already begun to see.

For the purposes of reading this book, please accept my definitions as I will use them for the purpose of making things clear.  The definitions must be kept congruous to differentiate things that are frequently conflated.  If it helps you can mentally append "Geoff is saying he means X when he says Y in this book", if the terminologies conflict too much with your existing use of the words.  I'm making a specific point about this, as I often have an internal feeling of rejecting an authors information based on their use of words from being different than how I would use them.  It's often a useful method to determine if the information is worth listening to, but in the case of a longer-term effort like reading a mentorship-oriented book, can cause you to miss out on crucial information.

The important part of this is that you gain insight into my perspectives, as I will be using those descriptions of my perspectives to build up a detailed map of how to inspect an environment, how to design and compose an environment, how to implement it, how to automate it, how to troubleshoot it, how to perform maintenance and life-cycle changes to it, how to document it, describe it to other people, etc.

This is all too much to do with just anyone's terminology, and the only terminology that will be able to consistently deliver these results inside of this book will be my own.  So try to accept all of these for the tools that they are in getting to these goals, and not as universal definitions that should be written into dictionaries, or compared against them.

I will be using the capitalization of proper nouns with these special terms, so that they are clearly my definition, for the purpose of this book, and not meant as the general term.  The only time this may be confusing is when the word starts the beginning of a sentence, but I hope context will keep that clear.
