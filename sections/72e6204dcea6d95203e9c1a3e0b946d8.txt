### [[3.4.1: Alignment]]

Alignment is one of the most important concepts of building efficient systems.

Any system can be described in a number of ways, but let us consider a system that is described as nodes and links between them, or edges, so that can be describe a system as a Graph.

Any point of interest in the system can be described as a node, and the connections between these points of interest are our links or edges.

Let us first consider a physical building structure, like a house, but we will simplify it into a wooden ceiling (flat board of equal width and length, and a small height) and 4 posts of wood to put the ceiling on top of.  You can consider the wooden posts to be "4x4 inch" beams or other material.

Now, in this example the purpose of the beams is to lift the ceiling board into the air, and keep it there.  So the beams function as support for the ceiling.  This defines the terms needed to start inspecting the concept of Alignment.

How can we begin to measure Alignment?  Let's make up a scale.

Alignment Efficiency

Least Efficient <=====> Most Efficient

Here is a basic scale of efficiency, going from least to most, which is pretty vague.

Let's start throwing some more variables in and seeing how this immediately becomes more interesting as a concept that I am claiming is a core concept of Engineering.

Let's assign different heights to the beams.  Lets say the beams are:  10 foot in height, 8 foot in height, 6 foot in height, 1 foot in height.

How efficient are these heights of beams at keeping a ceiling raised above the ground?

Firstly, when we think of a ceiling, we think of it generally as having an even height, or having some sort of stylistically (or functionally) changing height, but always we think of a ceiling as something we could be underneath.

If one of our boards is only 1 foot in height, then for part of our ceiling, we know we will not be able to reside underneath it, as there is not much space.  This does not sound like a very good ceiling.

This means, that we can reduce the "efficiency" of the ceiling we are proposing, because the ceiling is qualitatively "not good" from our definitions (goals) of what a ceiling should be.

Now, if qualitatively we wanted a flat ceiling above our heads, then this sloping ceiling is also "less good", and if we we're satisfied with a sloping ceiling, but require that it only slope in 1 dimension, then these heights of beams are also producing a qualitatively "less good" ceiling.

That covers some qualitative issues, but what about quantitatively?

There are several factors we can immediately state for quantitative measurements, such as:

- Vertical Weight bearing:  How much weight could be placed on the ceiling/roof, before the structure collapses?  You can imagine snow, if you need a concrete example.  As snow accumulates, the structure bears mode weight through the supporting beams, and is at risk of changing structure and eventually collapsing as this weight is delivered over time.  Even unweighted by extra material, the material in the beams and ceiling board themselves have weight and will over time degrade, so this is always a factor.

- Lateral force stability:  How much horizontal or lateral force can be applied to this structure, before it collapses?  Is it equal in all directions?  How stable is it in terms of falling on one of it's sides?  Etc.

Let's start with just these two factors, though there are many many more than can be applied, even in this trivial example.

In the case of the beams with 10, 8, 6, and 1 feet in height, if they are mounted vertically under the structure, which provides the maximum resistance to gravity (a vertical force), then only or 3 of these beams will ever touch the ground at any time, for any given combination of their placement.

This is obviously an inefficient design for keeping up a ceiling.

If the beams are connected to the ceiling at an angle, such as they allow for a "flat" ceiling (equal height from the ground in all parts), then the ceiling will only be 1 foot high, and the longer boards will be connected at very steep angles, which will provide less resistance to the gravity force pressing down on the ceiling and beams.

This can be calculated as quantifiably less efficient than beams that are all the same height, such as all being 10 feet in height.

In the same way as this physical example yields different qualitative and quantitative results with only the variance of heights of the boards, so every virtual difference yields different qualitative and quantitative results with every change.

Some virtual differences may yield "essentially the same results", for your level of interest in those results, but the results will always be different with different values.

This is why you must understand your own environment, requirements, resources and goals for yourself, in as deep and accurate manner as possible, so that you can understand what these small differences will yield.

This is an example of "local alignment", because we were only looking at: 1 ceiling, 4 beams, 1 goal (ceiling is efficient), 1 force (gravity).

No problem we ever deal with in life is this restricted.  Even for our above example, we will have to deal with weather (wetness, heat), biological (mold, termites), and many other factors for a real world "just a ceiling" problem, which massively complicate what "building an efficient ceiling out of 1 board and 4 beams" looks like.

In our modern Operational environments, we have hundreds of sub-goals, and thousands of instances of software, and millions of instances of data, even in small environments, all of which have different access patterns and reliability requirements.

If you can extrapolate out the ability to understand Alignment for our "simple ceiling" problem, and can extrude from that the importance of understanding Alignment in our much more complex and complicated real world environments, then you will see why I am maintaining that Alignment is one of the cores of Engineering, and that it is one of the first questions we must always ask in any kind of design related inquiry.

In future sections I will go into how Non-Local Alignment is one of the bigger problems we have to deal with in modern organizations today, because even good Local Alignment may yield poor Non-Local Alignment, as two or more sub-systems are working together in a larger integrated system, and while they may be locally efficient, they are not globally efficient.
