### [[3.5.1: There is no best, except for a certain set of values and priorities, from a limited set of options.]]

Best is a concept that is poorly understood in our culture.  It is frequently used, but rarely clarified, because it's vagueness gives it rhetorical power, but in engineering this is simply a logical fallacy that leads us to poor choices and low efficiency.

In order to take a term like "best" and use it in a manner that allows us to make good choices and have high efficiency, we must understand what other properties "best" has, besides just being "the best".

What are some properties of "best"?

- There is only one of them.  Only 1 thing can be "the best".

- Something cannot be "the best" for a great number of circumstances, because as the circumstances (variables) change, then what is "best" will also change.

- This creates an inverse ratio between the numbers of circumstances a methodology can be applied in, and the efficiency of the results for those circumstances.  This can be extended by allowing for any given set of circumstances (variables) to be repeated over and over.  The repetition will cause some of the variables to fluctuate (time itself being in constant fluctuation, others being contextual yet still being classified as being processed in the "same general manner").

- The inverse ratio suggests that for any given circumstance, there is one-and-only-one "best" answer, and potentially a small set of "close-enough-in-quantitative-results" class of answers that competes with the local-maximum of the "best" answer.

- Changing any of the requirements, resources or goals significantly will almost assuredly change which given solution is the "best" answer to the new problem.

This set of properties took it's shape through a line-of-reasoning, instead of enumerating things that were visible without reasoning, but both methods of defining properties are acceptable (simply remember how you came to them, in case they need re-evaluation).

In engineering we are not generally interested in the "worst" outcome as a result, but we need to brainstorm in finding potential problems to pre-solve against in coming up with our failure matrix for our services/etc.

Determining "worst" solutions is using the methodologies for "best" in reverse quantities.

In my view, this makes it clear that best/worst are a very small subset of options, and those options are highly detailed to one's exact environment, requirement, resources and goals.

As such, there can be no such thing as "Best Practices" (see section {{ section__e5829271e6cfb5927f3a4d4aec1b10df }} for details), because these are generalized solutions, for generalized environments, generalized resources available, and generalized goals.

"Best Practices" are useful to read as case-studies that someone is claiming a method worked well for them, and they can recommend it as a potentially useful method, but since this goes against our own understanding of what "best" really means, these should be reworded as "An Example Implementation", not a "Best Practice", as it is neither Best nor a Practice, since Practice connotes a deeper level of understanding that is provided than the very thin layer of a "recipe" and some case-study information.

In this book, I try to define for you, roughly, my Practice, for how to do engineering and operations.  I am trying to provide deep insight into how these things work, as I see them, and how I manipulate them to achieve results I desire, and how you can learn from my work and create your own.

Be careful with the language you use casually to describe things like "The Best Way To Do Something", in your giving or receiving of information, because the results you receive from taking those words at anywhere near their value may be far from the suggested-reality those words relayed to you.

"Best" has a powerful symbolic meaning to us.  Use it very carefully, or pay the consequences for wielding power poorly.

A better way to think of things is using the term "better".

Better is always a comparison between 2 distinct things.  Best is often only discussing 1 thing, and lumps everything else into the second category.

"Better" specifies 2 things, and it is known that "everything else" is not being considered at the moment, and so it not being discarded at the moment.  "Best" discards everything but the "best" immediately.

"Better" immediately leads to questions such as, "Why is it better?  In what way is better?  Any in what ways is it worse?"

When you think of "best" it does not immediately call into mind the same questions, because the power of the symbol of "best" is that there are no competitors, it is the best.

And yet, from our inspection earlier we see that "best" means a very limited set of scenarios, do we know that we described the scenarios accurately?  If the "best" is based on a limited set of scenarios, and we got anything wrong in our description of our scenario, than very likely we chose the wrong "best".

In comparison with "better", we have to be more explicit.  Our language compels us to describe the "better attributes" explicitly, and begs that we also describe the "worse attributes" in comparison.  "Best" does not beg that we describe the "worse", beca
