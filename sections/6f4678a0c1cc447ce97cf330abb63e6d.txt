### [[3.10.1.2: Modeling.  Creating models to understand.  Creating models to control.  Not the same.]]

To create a Model of something, is to try to "map" it some way.  Models can be made in any way you can think of, but typical models are things like:

- Data Schemas: such as in a relational database.
- Graphs: nodes and edges which define a sort of topology.
- Flow Charts, State Machines, Entity Relationship Maps, and other process diagrams.

Each type of Model is meant to provide the ability to simulate something, such as your Operational Environment.  

If you were to Model your Operational Environment with each method you could, some of the data would overlap between model-types, and some of the data would be unique per model-type.

Out all of these, the most fundamental type of modeling is the Data Schema model, and the Relational data schema model is the most comprehensive way to model this data.

This is because all data can be describes as collections of fields (tables), with relationships between them (inter-table field constraints)
