          - However, between Data and Logic is a huge gap, as Data is "perfectly" understandable, while Logic is not, due to Halting Problems and all other things CS-academia knows and describes very well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        [[dd889cf6d887f391188383b428c7ebfc]]
          - This difference also tells us why Data is more important than Logic, because Data is more trustworthy than Logic.  When making changes to data, the changes are straight-forward to understand, when making changes to Logic, the side-effects (unintended consequences) can be far-reaching and completely not understandable, and frequently enough are this way.

            - Changes to data, that meets constraints, will not harm other data, but can harm Logic that acts on the data (results of Logic, rather)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 [[3b9a062658c7f15e53b7601de12d3857]]

    - Your OpsDB is the desires and actionable knowledge of your company.  Everything inside it can be acted upon, it is better global information than any single person can have, so it is the best communication mechanism for a system that has multiple people with their own information (all companies over 1 employee).  Synchronizes information, makes transactional.

      - Know what kind of work you are going to start, and pick the best time to do so.  If it needs more ramp-up time, then pick a block where you are less likely to be interrupted.

      - Break your open time periods into "units" of 30 minutes or 2 hours or whatever you can have contiguously, and see what you can FINISH in that time.  It is easy to lose days/weeks to getting little changes made, but not moving ahead in terms of usable progress.

        - When each time block arrives, try to get what you can finish, and hopefully test and put into place, in that 1 session.  This isnt possible for some work, because it's too big, so break that into stages that can fit into one of these time blocks.  A simple method, would be: write it in 1, test it in another, and finally deploy it in the 3rd.

      - Too style oriented.  Enforcing a style is important in some areas, but less important in others.  It is better to keep a team cohevsive to know these differences, so that on some things you are strict (variable naming) and on other things you are flexible (commenting style).  People write prose more personally than they name variables, and variables have to be used by many people, whereas the message in a comment in based on the author's mental state when they wrote it, which is very subjective, and people have very different styles. [[7cfef0cbf3e4fb479b3309647eb17ca6]]
        - I recommend allowing people to have their own unique style in areas that will not harm the ease-of-use and resiliency/robustness of the Logic, and strictness on naming conventions, and basic formatting (indentation)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    [[3caece8edc80e43f05cec661ae0cf2f7]]
          - Strictness can be kept inside individual projects, with a general theme to a department or company.  These are degrees to each of this which will make actually working with other people nicer, while                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   [[8923934b9a6ece208968c72ceb0460c4]]

  -  Have "Wouldnt it be nice?" sections, where I posit what would be improvements I have yet to experience.  Coming to terms, agreeing on the foundational details, agreeing on the axioms, agreeing on how to relate data to the axioms.  Agreeing on how to act against axioms.  With these done, we can work much better as a team, and discuss them.
